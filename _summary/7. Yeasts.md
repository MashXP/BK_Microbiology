# 🍄 Yeasts

Yeasts are eukaryotic, single-celled microorganisms classified as members of the fungus kingdom.

## 🌍 Evolutionary Context
*   **Endosymbiotic Theory**:
    *   **Mitochondria**: Originated from Bacteria, specifically from lineages related to **Proteobacteria**.
    *   **Chloroplasts**: Originated from **Cyanobacteria**.
*   **Horizontal Gene Transfer**: Occurred within the community of early cells, contributing to genetic diversity.

## 🔬 Morphology, Structures, and Functions of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*

*Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is a species of yeast instrumental in winemaking, baking, and brewing.

* **Morphology**: Typically spherical to ovoid cells, 5-10 µm in diameter. They reproduce by **budding**.
* **Fission Yeasts**: (e.g., *Schizosaccharomyces pombe*) divide by **binary fission**.

### Cellular Structures

#### 1. Cell Wall
* Mainly composed of polysaccharides:
    * **Glucan**: A polymer of D-glucose (Main chain: $\beta$-1,3; Branched chain: $\beta$-1,6), provides structural support.
    * **Mannan**: A polymer of D-glucose (Main chain: $\alpha$-1,6; Branched: $\alpha$-1,2 and $\alpha$-1,3), often found as glycoproteins.
    * **Chitin**: A polymer of N-acetylglucosamine ($\beta$-1,4), found **mainly in scars**.
* Also contains mannoproteins, lipids, and inorganic phosphates.

#### 2. Periplasmic Space
* The space between the cell wall and the plasma membrane.
* Contains:
    * Mannoproteins
    * **Invertase**: Breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose.
    * **Phosphatase**: Breaks down inorganic phosphates.

#### 3. Plasma Membrane
* A semi-permeable phospholipid bilayer containing proteins, **sterols**, and possessing both **Polar and Non-polar regions**.
* Regulates the passage of materials into and out of the cell.

#### 4. Cytosol and Cytoskeleton
* **Cytosol**: The jelly-like substance filling the cell, containing ions, small molecules, and soluble macromolecules like enzymes. It contains **80S ribosomes**.
* **Cytoskeleton**: A network of microtubules and microfilaments that maintains cell shape and is involved in the movement of organelles and cell division.

#### 5. Nucleus and Extrachromosomal DNA
* The nucleus is surrounded by a nuclear membrane with pores and contains the cell's genome.
* The genome of *S. cerevisiae* consists of 16 linear chromosomes.
* **Extrachromosomal DNA**: Includes **mitochondrial DNA** and **plasmids**.

#### 6. Organelles
* **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)**: A network of membranes involved in protein and lipid synthesis.
* **Golgi Apparatus**: Composed of **cisterns**.
    *   Receives material from the ER via **transfer vesicles**.
    *   Releases material via **secretory vesicles**.
    *   Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids.
* **Vacuole**: A large, membrane-bound sac that contains enzymes for hydrolysis, stores amino acids and other nutrients, and regulates osmotic pressure.
* **Peroxisome**: An organelle containing oxidizing enzymes.
* **Mitochondrion**: The powerhouse of the cell, responsible for cellular respiration.
    *   **Outer membrane**: Contains enzymes metabolizing lipids.
    *   **Inner membrane**: Contains NADH dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, ATP synthase, and integrated transport proteins.
    *   **Matrix**: Contains enzymes for fatty acid oxidation and the citric acid cycle; contains mitochondrial DNA and components for replication/transcription.

## ⚡️ Metabolism: Respiration and Fermentation

* *S. cerevisiae* is a **facultative anaerobe**.
* **In the presence of oxygen (aerobic conditions)**, it performs cellular respiration to produce CO₂, water, and a large amount of ATP. The final electron acceptor (Oxygen) comes from **outside** the cell.
    1.  **Glycolysis**: Glucose is broken down into pyruvic acid, producing a small amount of ATP and NADH.
        -   **Glycolysis Yield**: 1 Glucose $\rightarrow$ 2 Pyruvic acid + 2 ATP (net) + 2 NADH.
    2.  **Krebs Cycle**: Pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl CoA and enters the cycle, producing ATP, NADH, and $FADH_2$.
        -   **Krebs Cycle Yield (per 2 Acetyl-CoA)**: 4 $CO_2$, 6 NADH, 2 $FADH_2$, and 2 ATP.
    3.  **Electron Transport Chain**: NADH and $FADH_2$ donate electrons to produce a large amount of ATP via chemiosmosis.
    -   **Chemiosmosis Location**:
        -   **Yeast (Eukaryote)**: Inner mitochondrial membrane.
        -   **Bacteria (Prokaryote)**: Plasma membrane.
* **In the absence of oxygen (anaerobic conditions)**, it performs **alcoholic fermentation**.
    * Glucose is converted to pyruvic acid (via glycolysis), which is then converted to **ethanol** and **$CO_2$**. This process yields a much smaller amount of ATP. The final electron acceptor is a molecule made **inside** the cell.
* The accumulation of ethanol is toxic to yeast, serving as a **density-dependent regulation of yeast population size**. This limits the alcohol content of fermented beverages to around 13%.

## 🔄 Reproduction

Yeasts can reproduce both asexually and sexually.

### Asexual Reproduction
* This occurs via **mitosis**.
* **Budding**: The most common form in *Saccharomyces*. A small bud grows out from the parent cell, receives a copy of the nucleus, and eventually detaches, leaving a **bud scar**.
* **Fission**: The cell elongates and divides into two equal-sized daughter cells.
* **Pseudohyphae**: Under certain conditions, budding cells may fail to detach, forming a chain of cells.
* **Key Concept**: How does a **bud** differ from a **spore**? (A bud is an asexual reproductive structure resulting from unequal cell division, while a spore is often a survival or sexual reproductive structure).

### Sexual Reproduction
* This life cycle is often triggered by environmental stress, such as **nitrogen starvation**.
1.  **Mating**: Involves the mating of two haploid cells (mating types **a** and **$\alpha$**).
    *   **Chemical Signaling**: Each type secretes a specific **mating factor** (a or $\alpha$) that binds to receptors on the opposite type. This binding induces changes that lead to cell fusion.
2.  **Zygote Formation**: The two haploid cells fuse to form a diploid **zygote** ($a/\alpha$).
3.  **Diploid Life**: This diploid cell can continue to reproduce asexually by budding (mitosis).
4.  **Meiosis and Sporulation**: When "starved," the diploid cell undergoes **meiosis** to produce four haploid **spores** (two 'a' and two '$\alpha$') within an ascus.
    *   **Meiosis I**: Prophase I, Metaphase I, Anaphase I (homologous chromosomes separate), Telophase I.
    *   **Meiosis II**: Prophase II, Metaphase II, Anaphase II (sister chromatids separate), Telophase II.
5.  **Germination**: These spores can germinate into new haploid cells.

## 🔢 Yeast Cell Quantification

Methods for counting yeast cells include:

*   **Direct Microscopic Count**: Using a **hemocytometer** (like a Neubauer chamber).
    *   **Advantage**: Fast.
    *   **Disadvantage**: Counts both living and **dead cells**.

    -   **Note**: Dead cells can be distinguished from living cells using viability dyes (e.g., Methylene Blue, where dead cells stain blue and living cells remain colorless).
*   **Plate Count**: Using serial dilutions and either the pour plate or spread plate method.
    *   **Advantage**: Counts only **viable cells** (Colony Forming Units, or CFUs).
    *   **Disadvantage**: Requires more time and materials.
    *   **Dilutions**: Standard dilutions used include 1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000, 1:10,000, and 1:100,000.
    *   **Pour Plate Method**:
        1.  Inoculate empty plate with sample.
        2.  Add melted nutrient agar.
        3.  Swirl to mix.
        4.  Colonies grow **on and in** the solidified medium.
    *   **Spread Plate Method**:
        1.  Inoculate plate containing solid medium (0.1 ml).
        2.  Spread inoculum over the surface evenly.
        3.  Colonies grow **only on the surface** of the medium.
*   **Filtration**: Used for low-concentration samples. Liquid is passed through a filter, which is then placed on a culture medium (e.g., Endo agar).
