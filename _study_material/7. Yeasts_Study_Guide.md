# 🍞 Study Guide: Yeasts

## 🚀 Executive Summary
This guide explores **Yeasts**, unicellular eukaryotic fungi. It covers their complex internal structures, distinct asexual (**Budding/Fission**) and sexual (**Meiosis/Mating**) reproductive cycles, and the metabolic pathways (like **Fermentation**) that make them industrially vital. Understanding yeasts provides a clear comparison between the simplicity of prokaryotes and the complexity of eukaryotes.

## 🔑 Key Terminology Table

| Term | Definition | Real-World Example/Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Budding** | Asexual reproduction where a new cell grows out of the parent cell. | Like a balloon animal being twisted to create a smaller bubble. |
| **Pseudohypha** | A chain of yeast cells that remain attached after budding. | Like a string of sausages. |
| **Dimorphism** | The ability of some fungi to grow as either a yeast or a mold depending on conditions. | A "shape-shifter" microbe (e.g., *Mucor*). |
| **Chitin** | A tough polysaccharide found in fungal cell walls. | The "exoskeleton" of the yeast cell. |
| **Fermentation** | Metabolic process converting sugar to alcohol and CO₂ in the absence of O₂. | The process that makes bread rise and beer alcoholic. |
| **Zygote** | A diploid cell formed by the fusion of two haploid mating types. | A microbial "marriage" result. |

## 🧠 Core Concepts (The Deep Dive)

### 1. Eukaryotic Structure
Yeasts are significantly more complex than bacteria. They possess:
*   **Nucleus:** Contains **16 straight chromosomes** (e.g., in *S. cerevisiae* S288C).
*   **Organelles:** Mitochondria (Outer/Inner membrane, matrix), Endoplasmic Reticulum (Rough and Smooth), Golgi body (cisterns), and large Vacuoles (enzyme storage and osmoregulation).
*   **Peroxisome:** Contains oxidizing enzymes.
*   **Periplasmic Space:** Contains enzymes like **Invertase** (sucrose -> glucose + fructose) and **Phosphatase**.
*   **Plasma Membrane:** A selective phospholipid bilayer containing **Sterols** (ergosterol) for stability.
*   **Cell Wall:** Composed of **Glucan** (main chain $\beta$-1,3), **Mannan** (main chain $\alpha$-1,6), and **Chitin** ($\beta$-1,4).
*   **Cytoskeleton:** Made of **microtubules and microfilaments** for cell shape and organelle movement.

### 2. Asexual Reproduction
1.  **Budding (e.g., *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*):** The parent cell forms a protrusion (bud). The nucleus divides, and one nucleus migrates into the bud. The bud eventually pinches off, leaving a **bud scar**.
2.  **Fission (e.g., *Schizosaccharomyces pombe*):** The parent cell elongates and divides symmetrically into two equal daughter cells via a transverse wall.

### 3. Sexual Reproduction (Meiosis & Mating)
Yeasts can exist in haploid ($n$) or diploid ($2n$) states.
*   **Mating:** Haploid cells of mating types **a** and **α** secrete chemical signaling factors (**a-factor** and **α-factor**). They fuse (**Plasmogamy** and **Karyogamy**) to form a diploid zygote ($2n$).
*   **Meiosis:** Under stress (e.g., nitrogen starvation), the diploid cell undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid **ascospores** ($n$). This involves **Meiosis I** (separating homologous chromosomes) and **Meiosis II** (separating sister chromatids).

### 4. Metabolism: Respiration vs. Fermentation
*   **Facultative Anaerobes:** Yeasts prefer O₂ for high ATP yield (Respiration) but can survive without it.
*   **Alcohol Fermentation:** In the absence of O₂, yeasts convert pyruvic acid into **Ethanol** and **CO₂**. 
    *   *Self-Limiting Factor:* Ethanol is toxic; most wine-producing yeast die when alcohol reaches ~13%.

### 5. Quantification Methods
*   **Hemocytometer (Direct):** Using a Neubauer improved counting chamber (0.1 mm depth) to count cells under a microscope. Counts both dead and live cells.
*   **Plate Count (Viable):** Serial dilution followed by **Pour Plate** or **Spread Plate** methods. Only counts cells that can divide into colonies.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
*   **Yeast vs. Bacteria:** Always remember yeasts are **Eukaryotes**. They have nuclei and 80S ribosomes (bacteria have 70S).
*   **Pseudohypha vs. Hypha:** Pseudohyphae are just buds that didn't let go; true hyphae (found in molds) are long, continuous filaments.
*   **Bud Scar Limit:** A yeast cell can only bud as many times as it has surface area. Once covered in scars, it can no longer divide.
