#  Bacteria & Archaea

## 🦠 Prokaryotes

-   The simplest organisms, with a simple cell structure.
-   They are single-celled organisms.
-   They lack a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
-   They are divided into two domains: Bacteria and Archaea.

##  Bacteria

-   Bacteria are ubiquitous, found in every habitat on Earth.
-   They are a major cause of disease in humans, animals, and plants.
-   They are also essential for many of life's processes.
-   They are involved in nutrient cycling, decomposition, and food production.

## 🔬 Bacterial Shapes, Arrangements, and Sizes

-   **Shapes**:
    -   **Coccus**: Spherical
    -   **Bacillus**: Rod-shaped
    -   **Spirillum**: Spiral-shaped
-   **Arrangements**:
    -   **Diplo**: in pairs
    -   **Strepto**: in chains
    -   **Staphylo**: in clusters
-   **Sizes**:
    -   Vary from 0.2 to 2.0 µm in diameter.

## 🧬 The Structure of Procaryotic Cells

-   Procaryotic cells have a simple structure.
-   They consist of a cell wall, cell membrane, and cytoplasm.
-   The cytoplasm contains ribosomes, a nucleoid, and inclusions.

##  Appendages

### Flagella

-   Long, whip-like structures that are used for motility.
-   They are composed of the protein flagellin.
-   They are anchored to the cell wall and cell membrane.

### Pili

-   Short, hair-like structures that are used for attachment to surfaces.
-   They are also involved in conjugation, a process of DNA transfer between bacteria.

### Fimbriae

-   Fine, hair-like bristles that are used for attachment to surfaces and other cells.
-   They are shorter and more numerous than pili.

## Glycocalyx

-   A coating of molecules external to the cell wall.
-   It is made of sugars and/or proteins.
-   There are two types:
    -   **Slime layer**: loosely organized and attached
    -   **Capsule**: highly organized, tightly attached
-   Functions:
    -   Attachment to surfaces
    -   Protection against phagocytosis
    -   Formation of biofilms

## 🧱 The Cell Envelope

-   External covering outside the cytoplasm.
-   Composed of two basic layers:
    -   Cell wall
    -   Cell membrane
-   Maintains cell integrity.

### The Cell Wall

-   A rigid structure that surrounds the cell membrane.
-   It provides structural support and protection to the cell.
-   It is composed of peptidoglycan (PG).

#### Peptidoglycan (PG)

-   A unique macromolecule composed of a repeating framework of long glycan chains cross-linked by short peptide fragments.
-   It is found only in bacteria.

#### Gram-Positive Cell Wall

-   Thick, homogeneous sheath of peptidoglycan (20-80 nm thick).
-   Includes teichoic acid and lipoteichoic acid.
-   These molecules function in cell wall maintenance and enlargement during cell division; move cations across the cell envelope; stimulate a specific immune response.

#### Gram-Negative Cell Wall

-   Composed of an outer membrane and a thin peptidoglycan layer.
-   The outer membrane is similar to the cell membrane, but it contains lipopolysaccharides (LPS).
-   LPS is a potent endotoxin that can cause fever and shock.
-   The thinness of the peptidoglycan layer gives gram-negative cells greater flexibility and sensitivity to lysis.

#### The Gram Stain

-   A differential stain that distinguishes cells with a gram-positive cell wall from those with a gram-negative cell wall.
-   Gram-positive bacteria retain the crystal violet stain and appear purple.
-   Gram-negative bacteria lose the crystal violet stain and are stained red by the safranin counterstain.

#### Nontypical Cell Walls

-   Some bacterial groups lack the typical cell wall structure.
-   For example, some bacteria lack a cell wall altogether.

##### Acid-Fast Bacteria

-   Like gram-positive cell walls.
-   Waxy layer of mycolic acid, cord factor.
-   Pathogenicity and high degree of resistance to certain chemicals and dyes.
-   Basis for acid-fast stain used for diagnosis of infections caused by these microorganisms.
-   e.g., *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*

##### Mycoplasmas

-   Lack a cell wall.
-   The cell membrane is stabilized by sterols.
-   They are pleomorphic (have various shapes).

### Cell Membrane

-   A thin, fluid-like structure that surrounds the cytoplasm.
-   It is composed of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins.
-   It is selectively permeable, meaning that it controls what enters and leaves the cell.
-   Functions in:
    -   Providing site for energy reactions, nutrient processing, and synthesis.
    -   Passage of nutrients into the cell and discharge of wastes.

## 🦠 Bacterial Internal Structures

### Cytoplasm

-   The dense, gelatinous solution of sugars, amino acids, and salts.
-   It is 70-80% water.
-   It serves as a solvent for materials used in all cell functions.

### Ribosomes

-   Made of 60% ribosomal RNA and 40% protein.
-   Consist of two subunits: large and small.
-   Prokaryotic ribosomes differ from eukaryotic ribosomes in size and number of proteins.
-   Site of protein synthesis.
-   Found in all cells.

### Inclusions

-   Intracellular storage bodies.
-   Vary in size, number, and content.
-   Bacterial cell can use them when environmental sources are depleted.
-   Examples: glycogen, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate, gas vesicles for floating, sulfur and phosphate granules (metachromatic granules).

### Nucleoid/Chromosome

-   The region of the cytoplasm where the bacterial chromosome is located.
-   The chromosome is a single, circular, double-stranded DNA molecule.
-   It contains all the genetic information of the cell.

### Plasmids

-   Small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecules that are separate from the bacterial chromosome.
-   They are not essential for bacterial growth and metabolism.
-   They can carry genes for antibiotic resistance, tolerance to toxic metals, and production of toxins.

### Bacterial Endospores

-   Inert, resting, cells produced by some G+ genera: *Clostridium*, *Bacillus*.
-   Have a 2-phase life cycle:
    -   **Vegetative cell**: metabolically active and growing.
    -   **Endospore**: when exposed to adverse environmental conditions; capable of high resistance and very long-term survival.
-   **Sporulation**: formation of endospores.
-   **Germination**: return to vegetative growth.
-   Endospores are resistant to heat, drying, freezing, radiation, and chemicals.
-   They are a concern in food preservation and medical microbiology.

##  Archaea

-   Constitute third Domain Archaea.
-   More closely related to Eukarya than to Bacteria.
-   Contain unique genetic sequences in their rRNA.
-   Have unique membrane lipids and cell walls.
-   Live in the most extreme habitats in nature, extremophiles.
-   Adapted to heat, salt, acid pH, pressure, and atmosphere.
-   Includes: methane producers, hyperthermophiles, extreme halophiles, and sulfur reducers.
