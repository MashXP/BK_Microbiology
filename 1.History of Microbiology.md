# History of Microbiology

## 🔬 Early Observations

*   **1665: Robert Hooke (England):**
    *   Discovered the smallest structure of life, which he called a "cell," using a crude microscope.
    *   This discovery opened the door to the "Cell Theory."
*   **1673: Anton van Leeuwenhoek (Netherlands):**
    *   Built over 400 microscopes with magnifying lenses.
    *   Was the first to observe and describe living single-celled organisms, which he called "animalcules." He described them in a series of letters to the British Royal Society between 1673 and 1723.

## 🌱 Spontaneous Generation vs. Biogenesis

This section covers the long-standing debate over whether life could arise from nonliving matter.

*   **Spontaneous Generation:** The idea that life can originate from nonliving things (e.g., flies from dung, maggots from rotting meat).
*   **1668: Francesco Redi (Italy):**
    *   Conducted an experiment with meat in covered and uncovered jars.
    *   Showed that maggots only appeared on the meat that flies could access, undermining the theory of spontaneous generation for larger organisms.
*   **1745: John Needham (England):**
    *   Heated broth and then sealed it. When the broth became cloudy with microorganisms, he argued it was evidence of spontaneous generation.
*   **1765: Lazzaro Spallanzani (Italy):**
    *   Suggested that Needham's broth was contaminated from the air *after* boiling.
    *   He boiled broth in a sealed flask and showed that no microorganisms grew, challenging Needham's findings. Needham countered that the "vital force" was destroyed by the heat and kept out by the seal.
*   **1858: Rudolf Virchow (Germany):**
    *   Introduced the concept of **biogenesis**, stating that living cells can only arise from pre-existing living cells.
*   **1861: Louis Pasteur (France):**
    *   Finally resolved the debate with his famous swan-neck flask experiment.
    *   He demonstrated that microorganisms are present in the air and can contaminate sterile solutions, but the air itself does not create microbes.
    *   Some of his original flasks are still on display at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and they remain uncontaminated after more than 100 years.

## 🏆 The Golden Age of Microbiology (1857-1914)

A period of explosive discoveries in microbiology, led by Pasteur and Robert Koch.

*   **Fermentation and Pasteurization:**
    *   **Pasteur (1857)** discovered that souring of beer and wine was caused by different types of bacteria.
    *   He developed **pasteurization** (1864), a process of heating liquids to kill spoilage-causing microbes.
*   **The Germ Theory of Disease:**
    *   The idea that microorganisms can cause disease.
    *   **Agostino Bassi (1835)** had shown that a fungus caused a silkworm disease.
    *   **Joseph Lister (1867)** applied the germ theory to medicine, using phenol to treat surgical wounds and reduce infections (aseptic surgery).
*   **Koch's Postulates:**
    *   **Robert Koch (1876)** provided the first proof that a specific bacterium (*Bacillus anthracis*) caused a specific disease (anthrax).
    *   He established **Koch's Postulates** (1884), a sequence of experimental steps for directly relating a specific microbe to a specific disease.
    *   He also developed pure culture techniques, using agar (Hess, 1882) and the Petri dish (Petri, 1887).
*   **Vaccination:**
    *   **Edward Jenner (1798)** discovered that inoculation with cowpox material could protect against smallpox, a process he called **vaccination**.
    *   **Pasteur (1880)** figured out *how* vaccines work, discovering that weakened (attenuated) bacteria could produce immunity.
*   **Other Key Discoveries:**
    *   **Neisser (1879):** Discovered *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*.
    *   **Finlay (1881):** Postulated that yellow fever is transmitted by mosquitoes.
    *   **Koch (1882):** Discovered *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.
    *   **Koch (1883):** Discovered *Vibrio cholerae*.
    *   **Metchnikoff (1884):** Described phagocytosis.
    *   **Gram (1884):** Developed the Gram stain.
    *   **Escherich (1887):** Discovered *Escherichia coli*.
    *   **Kitasato (1889):** Isolated *Clostridium tetani*.
    *   **von Behring (1890):** Developed diphtheria antitoxin.
    *   **Ehrlich (1890):** Proposed a theory of immunity.
    *   **Winogradsky (1892):** Described the sulfur cycle.
    *   **Shiga (1898):** Discovered *Shigella dysenteriae*.
    *   **Chagas (1910):** Discovered *Trypanosoma cruzi*.
    *   **Rous (1911):** Discovered a tumor-causing virus.

*   **Antibiotics:**
    *   **Paul Ehrlich (1910)** discovered salvarsan, an arsenic derivative used to treat syphilis.
    *   **Alexander Fleming (1928)** discovered the first true antibiotic, penicillin, produced by the fungus *Penicillium notatum*.

## 🏅 Second and Third Golden Ages of Microbiology

*   **Second Golden Age (1940s-1980s):**
    *   **Fleming, Chain, and Florey (1940s):** Developed penicillin.
    *   **Waksman (1940s):** Discovered streptomycin.
    *   **Beadle and Tatum (1941):** Showed that genes control biochemical reactions.
    *   **Enders, Weller, and Robbins (1949):** Grew poliovirus in cell culture.
    *   **Sanger and Gilbert (1960s):** Developed techniques for sequencing DNA.
    *   **Jerne, Köhler, and Milstein (1975):** Developed monoclonal antibody technology.
*   **Third Golden Age (1990s-Present):**
    *   **Murray and Thomas (1990):** Performed the first successful organ transplants using immunosuppressive drugs.
    *   **Mullis (1993):** Invented the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
    *   **Marshall and Warren (1990s):** Showed that *Helicobacter pylori* causes peptic ulcers.
    *   **Barré-Sinoussi and Montagnier (1983):** Discovered the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
    *   **Tu (2015):** Discovered artemisinin for malaria treatment.

## 🦠 Classification of Microorganisms

*   Based on similarities in ribosomal RNA, living organisms are classified into three domains:
    1.  **Bacteria**
    2.  **Archaea**
    3.  **Eukarya** (includes Fungi, Plantae, Animalia, and Protists)

*   **Types of Microorganisms:**
    *   Bacteria
    *   Fungi (Yeasts, Molds)
    *   Protists (Protozoa, Algae, Slime Molds)
    *   Viruses
