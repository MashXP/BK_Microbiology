# 🧪 Study Guide: Single Cell Protein (SCP) Production

## 🚀 Executive Summary
This guide explores **Single Cell Protein (SCP)**, also known as bioprotein or microbial protein. It covers the microbial sources (algae, bacteria, fungi, yeast), the substrates used for cultivation—often utilizing **agro-industrial waste**—and the industrial mechanisms of production. SCP serves as a sustainable, high-protein alternative to traditional food sources like fishmeal and soybean meal, although challenges like high nucleic acid content must be addressed.

## 🔑 Key Terminology Table

| Term | Definition | Real-World Example/Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Biomass** | The total weight of living microorganisms produced in a specific volume. | The "yield" of a microbial harvest. |
| **Substrate** | The raw material or waste product used as food for microorganisms. | Like "fuel" for a microbial engine. |
| **Submerged Fermentation** | Cultivation where microbes grow in a liquid medium with dissolved nutrients. | Growing yeast in a bubbling broth. |
| **Solid-State Fermentation** | Cultivation on solid substrates with limited moisture. | Growing mold on damp rice or wheat bran. |
| **Nucleic Acids** | DNA/RNA content in cells; high levels in SCP can cause uric acid buildup in humans. | A "byproduct" that must be limited in human diets. |
| **Pekilo Process** | A Finnish method using *Paecilomyces varioti* to produce SCP from wood/sulphite waste. | Turning paper-mill waste into animal feed. |

## 🧠 Core Concepts (The Deep Dive)

### 1. Sources of SCP & Substrates
*   **Bacteria:**
    *   *Methylococcaceae / Methylomonas:* C-1 compounds (Methane/Methanol).
    *   *Bacillus licheniformis / B. subtilis:* Potato waste, Ram horn.
    *   *Cellulomonas spp.:* Agro-industrial wastes.
    *   *Cupriavidus necator:* Synthetic media.
*   **Algae:**
    *   *Spirulina / Chlorella:* Carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and Sunlight.
    *   *Chlorella salina:* Alkaline waste effluent.
*   **Fungi (Molds):**
    *   *Aspergillus niger / A. flavus:* Rice bran, Apple pomace, Banana waste.
    *   *Trichoderma viride:* Citrus pulp.
    *   *Fusarium venenatum:* Glucose (used for human food "Quorn").
*   **Yeast:**
    *   *Saccharomyces cerevisiae:* Molasses, Orange pulp, Brewer's spent grain.
    *   *Candida utilis / Kluyveromyces marxianus:* Cheese whey, Rice bran.
    *   *Yarrowia lipolytica:* Crude oil, hydrocarbons.

#### 📊 Comparative Analysis of SCP Sources

| Source | Protein Content (Dry Mass) | Nucleic Acid Content | Doubling Time | Key Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bacteria** | **60–82%** (Highest) | High (Limiting factor) | **20–120 min** (Fastest) | High Vitamin B12; Resembles fish protein; Risk of **endotoxins**. |
| **Algae** | **40–70%** | **3–8%** (Low) | **2–6 hours** | High Vitamin A; Low harvest density; Needs light/$CO_2$. |
| **Yeast** | **45–55%** | High | **40 min – 3 hours** | High B-Complex Vitamins; Resembles soy protein. |
| **Fungi** | **30–50%** | **7–10%** | **2–4 hours** | High Lysine/Threonine; Deficient in Methionine/Cysteine. |

### 2. Substrates & Circular Economy
*   **Agricultural Waste:** Yam peels, apple pomace, rice bran, banana waste.
*   **Industrial Waste:** Whey (cheese), molasses, brewery wastewater, ram horn hydrolysate.
*   **Petrochemicals:** Methane, methanol, ethanol, and alkanes.
*   *Note:* Using waste reduces **Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)** by up to 80%.

### 3. Industrial Production & Fermentation
1.  **Submerged:** Liquid medium in a continuous fermenter; bacteria harvested by centrifugation.
2.  **Semisolid:** High investment; uses **U-loop fermenters** for optimized mass/energy transport.
3.  **Solid-State:** Microbes grown on solid beds (wheat bran) at 60-65% moisture.
4.  **Processing:** Involves purification, **cell disruption**, washing, and drying to ensure the product is inactive and non-toxic.

### 4. Nutritional Benefits & Aquaculture
*   **Amino Acid Profile:** Rich in **Lysine, Methionine, and Threonine**. Bacterial SCP resembles fish protein.
*   **Aquaculture Trials:**
    *   **Atlantic Salmon:**
        *   **36%** bacterial protein meal increased growth rate.
        *   **40%** *K. marxianus* or *C. utilis* can replace fishmeal.
        *   *Methylococcus capsulatus* prevents soybean-induced enteritis.
    *   **Rainbow Trout:** SCP can make up **38%** of the diet.
    *   **White Leg Shrimp:**
        *   **15-24%** *S. cerevisiae* products can replace fishmeal/soybean meal.
        *   Mixture of purple non-sulphur bacteria (1%) improves growth.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
*   **Nucleic Acid Risk:** High RNA (7-10% in fungi) causes uric acid buildup -> kidney stones or gout in humans.
*   **Toxicity:** Risk of mycotoxins (fungi) or endotoxins (bacteria).
*   **Active Microbes:** Live cells can cause skin/GI infections or nausea if not properly inactivated.
