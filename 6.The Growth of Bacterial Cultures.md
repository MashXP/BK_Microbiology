# 📈 The Growth of Bacterial Cultures

## ➗ Bacterial Division

-   Bacteria primarily reproduce through **binary fission**, where a single cell divides into two identical daughter cells.
-   The process involves:
    1.  Cell elongation and DNA replication.
    2.  The plasma membrane constricts, and a new cell wall is made.
    3.  A cross-wall forms, completely separating the two DNA copies.
    4.  The cells separate.

## ⏳ Generation Time

-   **Generation time** is the time required for a cell to divide (and its population to double).
-   It varies considerably among organisms and depends on environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, culture conditions).
-   Most bacteria have a generation time of 1 to 3 hours, but some can take over 24 hours.

### Calculation of Generation Time

-   **N₀**: Number of cells at the initial time (t₀)
-   **Nₜ**: Number of cells at a later time (t)
-   **n**: Number of generations in the time interval (t - t₀)

The formula to calculate the number of generations (n) is:
`n = (log(Nₜ) - log(N₀)) / log(2)`

The generation time (g) is then:
`g = (t - t₀) / n`

## 📊 The Growth Curve

A bacterial growth curve shows the changes in the size of a bacterial population over time in a batch culture. It has four distinct phases:

1.  **Lag Phase**: Intense activity preparing for population growth, but no increase in population size.
2.  **Log (Exponential) Phase**: Logarithmic, or exponential, increase in population. This is when cells are most metabolically active.
3.  **Stationary Phase**: The rate of microbial death balances the rate of new cell production. The population size stabilizes.
4.  **Death (Logarithmic Decline) Phase**: The population size decreases at a logarithmic rate as deaths exceed new cell formation.

## 📏 Measurement of Microbial Growth

### Direct Measurement Methods

#### 1. Direct Microscopic Count
-   A specific volume of a bacterial suspension is placed on a special slide called a **Petroff-Hausser counting chamber**.
-   The number of cells is counted in a defined area of the grid.
-   The total number of cells in the original sample is calculated based on the volume of the chamber.
-   This method counts both living and dead cells.

#### 2. Plate Count
-   This method counts only viable (living) cells that can form a colony on an agar plate. A colony is referred to as a **Colony-Forming Unit (CFU)**.
-   The original sample is serially diluted to obtain a countable number of colonies (usually between 30 and 300).
-   Methods:
    -   **Pour Plate Method**: The inoculum is mixed with melted agar and poured into a plate. Colonies grow on and within the solidified medium.
    -   **Spread Plate Method**: The inoculum is spread over the surface of a solid medium. Colonies grow only on the surface.

#### 3. Filtration
-   Used when the quantity of bacteria is very small (e.g., in lakes or streams).
-   A large volume of water is passed through a membrane filter that traps the bacteria.
-   The filter is then transferred to a petri dish containing a suitable medium, and the colonies are counted.

#### 4. The Most Probable Number (MPN) Method
-   A statistical estimation technique based on the principle that the more bacteria in a sample, the more dilution is needed to reduce the density to the point where no bacteria are left to grow.
-   The sample is serially diluted, and multiple tubes of broth are inoculated from each dilution.
-   The number of positive tubes (showing growth) in each set of dilutions is counted and compared to a statistical table to find the MPN.

### Indirect Measurement Methods

#### 1. Turbidity
-   As bacteria multiply in a liquid medium, the medium becomes turbid (cloudy).
-   A **spectrophotometer** is used to measure the turbidity. A beam of light is passed through the bacterial suspension, and the amount of light that passes through (transmittance) is measured.
-   The absorbance (or optical density, OD) is calculated from the transmittance and is proportional to the number of bacteria.
-   `OD = 2 - log(% Transmittance)`

#### 2. Dry Weight
-   The bacteria are removed from the growth medium by centrifugation, washed, and then dried in an oven.
-   The resulting dry weight is proportional to the number of bacteria.
-   This method is useful for filamentous organisms like fungi.

#### 3. Metabolic Activity
-   Assumes that the amount of a certain metabolic product (e.g., acid, CO₂) is directly proportional to the number of bacteria present.

## ✍️ Constructing a Growth Curve

1.  Prepare activated bacterial cells for inoculation.
2.  Prepare a liquid medium in a suitable vessel.
3.  Inoculate the medium with the culture.
4.  Cultivate the culture under suitable conditions.
5.  Take samples periodically and determine the cell density using a suitable measurement method.
6.  Construct a curve showing the dependence of the amount of biomass produced on the culture time.
