### Page 10

**Detailed Description:**
This page displays a comprehensive decision tree (dichotomous key) designed for identifying selected species of human pathogens, specifically those isolated from marine mammals. The key uses a series of biochemical tests and morphological observations to narrow down the identification to a specific bacterial genus or species. Below the diagram, there's a title and a question that challenges the user to apply the key.

**Visible Text:**
*   **Title below the diagram (black text):** "Biochemical tests used to identify selected species of human pathogens isolated from marine mammals."
*   **Question (black text, "Q" in red box):** "Q Assume you isolated a gram-negative rod that is oxidase-positive, is indole-negative, and does not produce urease or acetoin. What is the bacterium?"

**Diagrams, Charts, or Images:**
The main content is a large flow chart or decision tree, with purple boxes representing tests/observations and teal boxes representing identified bacteria. Arrows indicate the path to follow based on positive (+) or negative (-) results.

The key starts with:
*   **"Gram reaction?"** (Purple box)
    *   **Negative (-):** Leads to "Oxidase?" (Purple box)
        *   **Yes (+):** Leads to "Urea hydrolyzed?" (Purple box)
            *   **Yes (+):** Leads to "H2S produced?" (Purple box)
                *   **Yes (+):** Leads to "Bordetella bronchiseptica" (Teal box)
                *   **No (-):** Leads to "Brucella cell" (Teal box - *Note: "cell" is likely a typo for "spp." or genus name*)
            *   **No (-):** Leads to "Indole produced?" (Purple box)
                *   **Yes (+):** Leads to "Acetoin produced? (V-P test)" (Purple box)
                    *   **Yes (+):** Leads to "Aeromonas hydrophila" (Teal box)
                    *   **No (-):** Leads to "Pasteurella multocida" (Teal box)
                *   **No (-):** Leads to "Mannheimia haemolytica" (Teal box)
        *   **No (-):** Leads to "Citrate utilized?" (Purple box)
            *   **Yes (+):** Leads to "Klebsiella pneumoniae" (Teal box)
            *   **No (-):** Leads to "Yersinia enterocolitica" (Teal box)
    *   **Positive (+):** Leads to "Morphology?" (Purple box)
        *   **Cocci:** Leads to "Staphylococcus aureus" (Teal box)
        *   **Rods:** Leads to "Acid-fast?" (Purple box)
            *   **Yes (+):** Leads to "Nocardia asteroides" (Teal box)
            *   **No (-):** Leads to "H2S produced?" (Purple box)
                *   **Yes (+):** Leads to "Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae" (Teal box)
                *   **No (-):** Leads to "Arcanobacterium phocae" (Teal box)

**Answering the Question:**
Tracing the path for the given characteristics:
1.  **Gram-negative rod:** Follow "Gram reaction? -> Negative" (Left path). The 'rod' morphology is implied as this branch leads to various rod-shaped bacteria.
2.  **Oxidase-positive:** Follow "Oxidase? -> Yes" (Left path).
3.  **Does not produce urease:** Follow "Urea hydrolyzed? -> No" (Right path).
4.  **Indole-negative:** Follow "Indole produced? -> No" (Right path).
5.  **Does not produce acetoin:** This leads to "Acetoin produced? (V-P test) -> No" (Right path).

Following this sequence of decisions (Negative -> Oxidase Yes -> Urea No -> Indole No -> Acetoin No) directly leads to **Mannheimia haemolytica**.

## Pages 11-15

Here is a detailed analysis of the provided 5 pages from a microbiology presentation:

---

### Page 11

**Content Description:**
This page primarily presents an introductory paragraph about the *Enterobacteriaceae* family and a diagnostic flowchart for identifying selected genera within this family using metabolic characteristics.

**Visible Text:**
The main body text at the top of the page reads:
"All members of the family **Enterobacteriaceae** do not contain oxidase, including members of the genera *Escherichia*, *Enterobacter*, *Shigella*, *Citrobacter*, and *Salmonella*. *Escherichia*, *Enterobacter*, and *Citrobacter* can ferment lactose to produce acid and gas, which distinguishes them from *Salmonella* and *Shigella*. Other biochemical tests can differentiate species of different genera."

**Diagram/Chart/Image:**
A large flowchart titled "Figure 10.8 The use of metabolic characteristics to identify selected genera of enteric bacteria." is prominently displayed. The flowchart is a decision tree based on biochemical tests:

*   **Starting Point:** The first decision node asks: "Can they ferment lactose?"
    *   **"No" path:** Leads to a second decision node: "Can they use citric acid as their sole carbon source?"
        *   **"No" path:** Leads to the identification: "**Shigella**: produces lysine decarboxylase"
        *   **"Yes" path:** Leads to the identification: "**Salmonella**: generally produces H₂S"
    *   **"Yes" path:** Leads to a second decision node: "Can they use citric acid as their sole carbon source?"
        *   **"No" path:** Leads to a third decision node: "Can they ferment sorbitol?"
            *   **"No" path:** Leads to the identification: "**E. coli O157**"
            *   **"Yes" path:** Leads to the identification: "**other Escherichia coli strains**"
        *   **"Yes" path:** Leads to a third decision node: "Do they produce acetoin?"
            *   **"No" path:** Leads to the identification: "**Citrobacter**"
            *   **"Yes" path:** Leads to the identification: "**Enterobacter**"

**Question:**
Below the flowchart, a question is posed for the user to apply the chart:
"Assume you have a gram-negative bacterium that produces acid from lactose and cannot use citric acid as its sole carbon source. What is the bacterium?" (The answer, following the chart: "Yes" to lactose fermentation, "No" to citric acid use, leads to the "Can they ferment sorbitol?" node, which further branches into *E. coli O157* or *other Escherichia coli strains* depending on sorbitol fermentation. Without sorbitol information, it's narrowed down to *Escherichia coli* species.)

### Page 12

**Content Description:**
This page illustrates the steps involved in using a rapid identification system for bacteria, specifically the EnteroPluri test from BD Diagnostics. It shows the inoculation, incubation, and interpretation of results.

**Visible Text:**

*   **Step 1:** "One tube containing media for 15 biochemical tests is inoculated with an unknown enteric bacterium."
*   **Step 2:** "After incubation, the tube is observed for results."
*   **Step 3:** "The value for each positive test is circled, and the numbers from each group of tests are added to give the code number."
*   **Step 4:** "Comparing the resultant code number with a computerized listing shows that the organism in the tube is *Citrobacter freundii*."

**Diagrams/Charts/Images:**
The page features three main images and a table, demonstrating the EnteroPluri test:

1.  **Image (Top):** A human hand is shown holding a multi-compartment plastic tube (the EnteroPluri tube). An inoculation loop is inserted into one of the compartments, demonstrating the inoculation process. The tube contains various colored media.
2.  **Image (Middle):** Two identical multi-compartment tubes are displayed horizontally. The top tube represents an incubated tube with various color changes in its compartments, indicating biochemical test results. Below this tube, labels identify the specific biochemical tests for each compartment: "Glucose", "Gas", "Lysine", "Ornithine", "H₂S", "Indole", "Adonitol", "Lactose", "Arabinose", "Sorbitol", "V-P", "Dulcitol", "Phenylalanine", "Urease", "Citrate".
3.  **Image (Bottom):** This image is a closer view of an incubated tube, illustrating the interpretation of results. Below the tube, the 15 tests are grouped into five sets of three. For each set, specific values (1, 2, or 4) are assigned to the individual tests. Positive tests have their corresponding value circled. The sum of the circled values within each group is written below the bracket for that group. For example:
    *   Group 1 (Glucose, Gas, Lysine): Glucose (1) and Gas (2) are positive, summing to **3**.
    *   Group 2 (Ornithine, H₂S, Indole): H₂S (2) is positive, summing to **2**.
    *   Group 3 (Adonitol, Lactose, Arabinose): Adonitol (1) and Lactose (2) are positive, summing to **3**.
    *   Group 4 (Sorbitol, V-P, Dulcitol): V-P (2) and Dulcitol (4) are positive, summing to **6**.
    *   Group 5 (Phenylalanine, Urease, Citrate): Urease (2) is positive, summing to **2**.
    This results in a 5-digit code: **32362**.

**Table (Bottom Right):**
A table titled by **Step 4** (as mentioned above) shows:
| Code Number | Microorganism        | Atypical Test Results |
| :---------- | :------------------- | :-------------------- |
| 62342       | *Citrobacter freundii* | Citrate               |
| 62343       | *Citrobacter freundii* | None                  |

**Caption:**
"Figure 10.9 One type of rapid identification method for bacteria: EnteroPluri test from BD Diagnostics. This example shows results for a typical strain of *C. freundii*; however, other strains may produce different test results, which are listed in the Atypical Test Results column."

**Question:**
"How can one species have two different code numbers?"

### Page 15

**Content Description:**
This page presents the chemical structures of two stereoisomers of Diaminopimelic acid: meso-DAP and L-DAP.

**Visible Text & Images:**

*   **meso-DAP:**
    *   On the left side of the page, the chemical structure of meso-Diaminopimelic acid is shown. This isomer has a plane of symmetry, meaning its two chiral centers have opposite configurations.
    *   Below the structure, it is labeled "meso-DAP".
*   **L-DAP:**
    *   On the right side of the page, the chemical structure of L-Diaminopimelic acid is shown. This isomer typically refers to the (L,L) configuration, where both chiral centers have the L-configuration.
    *   Below the structure, it is labeled "L-DAP".

Both structures visually represent HOOC-CH(NH₂)-(CH₂)₃-CH(NH₂)-COOH, with the distinction between meso and L forms implied by the stereochemical representation of the NH₂ groups relative to the main chain.

## Pages 21-22

Here is a detailed analysis of the two provided pages from a microbiology presentation, focusing on the content of the NCBI BLAST results.

---

### Page 21

This page displays the "Descriptions" summary of a Nucleotide BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search performed on the NCBI website. It provides an overview of sequences in the database that show significant similarity to the user's query sequence.

**Overall Browser Elements (Consistent across both pages):**
*   **Browser Type:** Google Chrome (indicated by the icon in the top left corner of the window frame).
*   **Window Title:** "NCBI Blast: Nucleotide Seque..." (likely "Sequence Alignment" or "Sequence Results").
*   **URL Bar:** Displays the address `https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi`, indicating that this is a dynamic page generated by a BLAST query.
*   **Browser Controls:** Standard browser tabs (one visible, labeled "NCBI Blast: Nucleotide Seque..."), refresh, home, bookmark, and Chrome menu (three vertical dots) icons are visible. Window minimize, maximize, and close buttons are also present.
*   **Left Sidebar (Collapsed):** A thin grey sidebar on the left shows icons, with a checkmark next to "Descriptions," indicating that this view is currently selected.

**Main Content Area - Descriptions:**

*   **Header:** A large blue header prominently displays "Descriptions," confirming the current view.
*   **Section Title:** "Sequences producing significant alignments:" This heading introduces the table of results below.
*   **Selection Controls:** "Select: All None Selected: 0" provides options to select multiple results.
*   **Navigation Tabs:** A row of tabs is visible, with "Alignments" currently underlined (suggesting it might be the default or a primary tab, even though the current view is "Descriptions"). Other tabs are "Download", "GenBank", "Graphics", and "Distance tree of results". These tabs likely offer different ways to view or export the BLAST results.
*   **Table of Results:** This is the main content area, displaying a list of database sequences that matched the query.
    *   **Column Headers:**
        *   (Implicit Checkbox Column): On the far left for selecting individual entries.
        *   **Description:** Provides the name and details of the matched sequence, including the organism, gene name, and often "partial sequence."
        *   **Max score:** The highest alignment score achieved between the query and a segment of the subject sequence.
        *   **Total score:** The sum of alignment scores of all segments that align between the query and the subject sequence.
        *   **Query cover:** The percentage of the query sequence that is covered by the alignment(s).
        *   **E value:** (Expect value) The number of hits one can "expect" to see by chance when searching a database of a particular size. Lower E-values indicate more significant matches.
        *   **Ident:** (Identity) The percentage of identical bases between the aligned query and subject sequences.
        *   **Accession:** A unique identifier for the sequence in the NCBI database. These are hyperlinked (blue text) for direct access to the sequence record.
    *   **Visible Rows (Top 5 examples):**
        *   **1st Row:**
            *   Description: `Streptomyces flaveus strain X418 16S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence`
            *   Scores: Max score: 870, Total score: 870
            *   Query cover: 100%
            *   E value: 0.0
            *   Ident: 0.0 (Note: This "0.0" for Identity is unusual given 100% query cover and E-value of 0.0. It might be a display error or placeholder in this specific view, as the detailed alignment on Page 2 shows 100% identity for this entry).
            *   Accession: `gb|JX293177.1`
        *   **2nd Row:**

            *   Accession: `gb|HQ850408.1`
        *   **4th Row:**
            *   Description: `Streptomyces flaveus strain T111 16S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence`
            *   Scores: Max score: 870, Total score: 870
            *   Query cover: 100%
            *   E value: 0.0
            *   Ident: 0.0 (Same anomaly as above).
            *   Accession: `gb|GU084180.1`
        *   **5th Row:**
            *   Description: `Streptomyces sp. SXY10 16S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence`
            *   Scores: Max score: 870, Total score: 870

    *   **Number of Matches:** `1` (number of distinct alignment regions found).
    *   **Alignment Range:** `Range 1: 29 to 499` (indicates that the alignment covers bases 29 through 499 of the subject sequence).
    *   **Match Navigation:** "Next Match", "Previous Match" (for navigating if there were multiple distinct alignments within this single hit).
    *   **Alignment Statistics:**
        *   **Score:** `870 bits(471)` (Score in bits and raw score in parentheses).
        *   **Expect:** `0.0` (E-value).
        *   **Identities:** `471/471(100%)` (This confirms 100% identity, resolving the ambiguity from Page 1's "0.0" Ident column for this entry).
        *   **Gaps:** `0/471(0%)` (No gaps were introduced in the alignment).
        *   **Strand:** `Plus/Plus` (Both query and subject sequences are aligned in the forward orientation).
    *   **Sequence Alignment Display:** This is the core of the detailed alignment.
        *   It shows the query sequence (`Query`) and the subject sequence (`Sbjct`) aligned side-by-side.
        *   **Query line:** Shows a segment of the query sequence and its base numbering (e.g., `Query 1 ... 60`).
        *   **Middle line:** Consists of vertical bars (`|`) indicating identical bases between Query and Subject.
        *   **Subject line:** Shows the corresponding segment of the subject sequence from the database and its base numbering (e.g., `Sbjct 29 ... 88`).
        *   The alignment shows segments of 60 bases per line, with the numbering incrementing on the right. For example, the first alignment segment shows:
            ```
            Query  1  TGCTGCGGTAGACGTCGCAAGTCGCGGTCTTAACCATAGGCGCACGCCCTTCTGCGGCGT  60
                      ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
            Sbjct  29 TGCTGCGGTAGACGTCGCAAGTCGCGGTCTTAACCATAGGCGCACGCCCTTCTGCGGCGT  88
            ```
        *   The alignment continues downwards, covering Query positions 1 through 499, aligning to Subject positions 29 through 527.

*   **Second Detailed Alignment Block (Partially Visible):**
    *   A horizontal separator line indicates the start of a new alignment.
    *   **Action Buttons & Navigation:** Repeated for this alignment ("Download", "GenBank", "Graphics", "Next", "Previous", "Descriptions").
    *   **Hit Description:** `Streptomyces sp. NEAU-P17 16S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence` (Matches the second entry from Page 1).
