# 🍄 Yeasts

Yeasts are eukaryotic, single-celled microorganisms classified as members of the fungus kingdom.

## 🔬 Morphology, Structures, and Functions of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*

*Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is a species of yeast instrumental in winemaking, baking, and brewing.

* **Morphology**: Typically spherical to ovoid cells, 5-10 µm in diameter. They reproduce by **budding**.
* **Fission Yeasts**: (e.g., *Schizosaccharomyces pombe*) divide by **binary fission**.

### Cellular Structures

#### 1. Cell Wall
* Mainly composed of polysaccharides:
    * **Glucan**: A polymer of D-glucose, provides structural support.
    * **Mannan**: A polymer of D-glucose, often found as glycoproteins.
    * **Chitin**: A polymer of N-acetylglucosamine, found mainly in bud scars.
* Also contains mannoproteins, lipids, and inorganic phosphates.

#### 2. Periplasmic Space
* The space between the cell wall and the plasma membrane.
* Contains enzymes like:
    * **Invertase**: Breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose.
    * **Phosphatase**: Breaks down inorganic phosphates.

#### 3. Plasma Membrane
* A semi-permeable phospholipid bilayer containing proteins and **sterols**.
* Regulates the passage of materials into and out of the cell.

#### 4. Cytosol and Cytoskeleton
* **Cytosol**: The jelly-like substance filling the cell, containing ions, small molecules, and soluble macromolecules like enzymes. It contains **80S ribosomes**.
* **Cytoskeleton**: A network of microtubules and microfilaments that maintains cell shape and is involved in the movement of organelles and cell division.

#### 5. Nucleus and Extrachromosomal DNA
* The nucleus is surrounded by a nuclear membrane with pores and contains the cell's genome.
* The genome of *S. cerevisiae* consists of 16 linear chromosomes.
* **Extrachromosomal DNA**: Includes **mitochondrial DNA** and **plasmids**.

#### 6. Organelles
* **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)**: A network of membranes involved in protein and lipid synthesis.
* **Golgi Apparatus**: Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for secretion or delivery to other organelles.
* **Vacuole**: A large, membrane-bound sac that contains enzymes for hydrolysis, stores amino acids and other nutrients, and regulates osmotic pressure.
* **Peroxisome**: An organelle containing oxidizing enzymes.
* **Mitochondrion**: The powerhouse of the cell, responsible for cellular respiration. It has an outer membrane, an inner membrane (with cristae), and a matrix containing enzymes for the citric acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation.

## ⚡️ Metabolism: Respiration and Fermentation

* *S. cerevisiae* is a **facultative anaerobe**.
* **In the presence of oxygen (aerobic conditions)**, it performs cellular respiration to produce CO₂, water, and a large amount of ATP.
    1.  **Glycolysis**: Glucose is broken down into pyruvic acid, producing a small amount of ATP and NADH.
    2.  **Krebs Cycle**: Pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl CoA and enters the cycle, producing ATP, NADH, and $FADH_2$.
    3.  **Electron Transport Chain**: NADH and $FADH_2$ donate electrons to produce a large amount of ATP via chemiosmosis.
* **In the absence of oxygen (anaerobic conditions)**, it performs **alcoholic fermentation**.
    * Glucose is converted to pyruvic acid (via glycolysis), which is then converted to **ethanol** and **$CO_2$**. This process yields a much smaller amount of ATP.
* The accumulation of ethanol is toxic to yeast, which limits the alcohol content of fermented beverages to around 13%.

## 🔄 Reproduction

Yeasts can reproduce both asexually and sexually.

### Asexual Reproduction
* This occurs via **mitosis**.
* **Budding**: The most common form in *Saccharomyces*. A small bud grows out from the parent cell, receives a copy of the nucleus, and eventually detaches, leaving a **bud scar**.
* **Fission**: The cell elongates and divides into two equal-sized daughter cells.
* **Pseudohyphae**: Under certain conditions, budding cells may fail to detach, forming a chain of cells.

### Sexual Reproduction
* This life cycle is often triggered by environmental stress, such as **nitrogen starvation**.
1.  **Mating**: Involves the mating of two haploid cells (mating types **a** and **$\alpha$**). They secrete mating factors to find each other.
2.  **Zygote Formation**: The two haploid cells fuse to form a diploid **zygote** ($a/\alpha$).
3.  **Diploid Life**: This diploid cell can continue to reproduce asexually by budding (mitosis).
4.  **Meiosis and Sporulation**: When "starved," the diploid cell undergoes **meiosis** to produce four haploid **spores** (two 'a' and two '$\alpha$') within an ascus.
5.  **Germination**: These spores can germinate into new haploid cells.

## 🗂️ Classification

* **Domain**: Eukarya
* **Kingdom**: Fungi
* **Phylum**: Ascomycota (sac fungi) or Basidiomycota
    * **Ascomycota**: Includes *Saccharomycotina* (true yeasts) and *Taphrinomycotina* (fission yeasts).
    * **Basidiomycota**: Includes yeasts like *Cryptococcus neoformans*.

## 🔢 Yeast Cell Quantification

Methods for counting yeast cells include:

* **Direct Microscopic Count**: Using a **hemocytometer** (like a Neubauer chamber).
    * **Advantage**: Fast.
    * **Disadvantage**: Counts both living and **dead cells**.
* **Plate Count**: Using serial dilutions and either the pour plate or spread plate method.
    * **Advantage**: Counts only **viable cells** (Colony Forming Units, or CFUs).
    * **Disadvantage**: Requires more time and materials.
