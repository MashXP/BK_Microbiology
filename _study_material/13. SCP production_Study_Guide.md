# 🧪 Study Guide: Single Cell Protein (SCP) Production

## 🚀 Executive Summary
This guide explores **Single Cell Protein (SCP)**, also known as bioprotein or microbial protein. It covers the microbial sources (algae, bacteria, fungi, yeast), the substrates used for cultivation—often utilizing **agro-industrial waste**—and the industrial mechanisms of production. SCP serves as a sustainable, high-protein alternative to traditional food sources like fishmeal and soybean meal, although challenges like high nucleic acid content must be addressed.

## 🔑 Key Terminology Table

| Term | Definition | Real-World Example/Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Biomass** | The total weight of living microorganisms produced in a specific volume. | The "yield" of a microbial harvest. |
| **Substrate** | The raw material or waste product used as food for microorganisms. | Like "fuel" for a microbial engine. |
| **Submerged Fermentation** | Cultivation where microbes grow in a liquid medium with dissolved nutrients. | Growing yeast in a bubbling broth. |
| **Solid-State Fermentation** | Cultivation on solid substrates with limited moisture. | Growing mold on damp rice or wheat bran. |
| **Nucleic Acids** | DNA/RNA content in cells; high levels in SCP can cause uric acid buildup in humans. | A "byproduct" that must be limited in human diets. |
| **Pekilo Process** | A Finnish method using *Paecilomyces varioti* to produce SCP from wood/sulphite waste. | Turning paper-mill waste into animal feed. |

## 🧠 Core Concepts (The Deep Dive)

### 1. Sources of SCP
*   **Bacteria:** Fastest growth (20-120 min generation time), highest protein content (**60-82%**).
    *   *Examples:* **Bacillus licheniformis** (potato waste), **Methylococcus capsulatus** (natural gas), **Cupriavidus necator** (synthetic media).
*   **Algae:** Use solar energy and CO₂; rich in vitamins, pigments, and **Omega-3s**.
    *   *Examples:* **Spirulina**, **Chlorella**. Can prevent fatty liver syndrome.
*   **Fungi/Molds:** Easier to harvest (filtration) due to filamentous structure; protein content **30-50%**.
    *   *Examples:* **Aspergillus niger** (citrus pulp), **Fusarium venenatum** (lowers blood glucose).
*   **Yeast:** High vitamin B content; protein resembles soybean protein.
    *   *Examples:* **Saccharomyces cerevisiae** (orange pulp/molasses), **Candida utilis** (cheese whey).

### 2. Substrates & Circular Economy
*   **Agricultural Waste:** Yam peels, apple pomace, rice bran, banana waste.
*   **Industrial Waste:** Whey (cheese), molasses, brewery wastewater, ram horn hydrolysate.
*   **Petrochemicals:** Methane, methanol, ethanol, and alkanes.
*   *Note:* Using waste reduces **Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)** by up to 80%.

### 3. Industrial Production & Fermentation
1.  **Submerged:** Liquid medium in a continuous fermenter; bacteria harvested by centrifugation.
2.  **Semisolid:** High investment; uses **U-loop fermenters** for optimized mass/energy transport.
3.  **Solid-State:** Microbes grown on solid beds (wheat bran) at 60-65% moisture.
4.  **Processing:** Involves purification, **cell disruption**, washing, and drying to ensure the product is inactive and non-toxic.

### 4. Nutritional Benefits & Aquaculture
*   **Amino Acid Profile:** Rich in **Lysine, Methionine, and Threonine**. Bacterial SCP resembles fish protein.
*   **Aquaculture Trials:**
    *   **Atlantic Salmon:** *M. capsulatus* can replace 52% of dietary protein and prevents **soybean-induced enteritis**.
    *   **Rainbow Trout:** SCP can make up 38% of the diet.
    *   **White Leg Shrimp:** Mixture of purple non-sulphur bacteria improves growth and survival.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
*   **Nucleic Acid Risk:** High RNA (7-10% in fungi) causes uric acid buildup -> kidney stones or gout in humans.
*   **Toxicity:** Risk of mycotoxins (fungi) or endotoxins (bacteria).
*   **Active Microbes:** Live cells can cause skin/GI infections or nausea if not properly inactivated.
