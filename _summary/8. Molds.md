# 🍄 Molds (The Fungi)

Molds are a large and taxonomically diverse number of fungal species where the growth of hyphae results in a discoloration and a fuzzy appearance, especially on food.

## 🌿 Characteristics of Fungi

* **Eukaryotic**: Have a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
* **Evolutionary Context**:
    * **Mitochondria**: Originated from **Bacteria** (specifically Proteobacteria).
    * **Chloroplasts**: Originated from **Cyanobacteria**.
    * Horizontal gene transfer occurred within the community of early cells.
* **Heterotrophic**: Obtain nutrients by absorbing them from their environment.
* **Cell Wall**: Composed of **Glucans; mannans; chitin (no peptidoglycan)**.
* **Body Plan**: Can be unicellular (yeasts) or multicellular (molds). Multicellular fungi are composed of filaments called **hyphae**.
* **Mycology**: The study of fungi.

| Feature | Fungi | Bacteria |
|---|---|---|
| **Cell Type** | Eukaryotic | Prokaryotic |
| **Cell Membrane** | Sterols present | Sterols absent (except *Mycoplasma*) |
| **Cell Wall** | Glucans, Mannans, Chitin (no peptidoglycan) | Peptidoglycan |
| **Spores** | Sexual & Asexual reproductive spores | Endospores (survival, not reproduction) |
| **Metabolism** | Heterotrophic; aerobic or facultatively anaerobic | Heterotrophic or Autotrophic; aerobic or anaerobic |

## 🌳 The Body Plan of Fungi

* **Hyphae**: Long, branching, filamentous structures. A mass of hyphae is called a **mycelium**.
    * **Key Structures**: Hyphae contain organelles such as the **Nucleus**, **Plasma membrane**, **Mitochondrion**, **Endoplasmic reticulum**, **Ribosomes**, **Vacuole**, and **Oil droplets**.
    * **Septate hyphae**: Contain cross-walls (septa) that divide the hyphae into distinct cells.
    * **Coenocytic (aseptate) hyphae**: Lack septa and are a continuous mass of cytoplasm with multiple nuclei.
* **Vegetative Hyphae**: The portion of a hypha that obtains nutrients.
* **Aerial (Reproductive) Hyphae**: The portion that projects above the surface of the medium on which the fungus is growing and is connected with reproduction, often bearing spores.

### Key Structures and Growth
*   Hyphae grow by elongating at the tips.
*   Each part of a hypha is capable of growth, and when a fragment breaks off, it can elongate to form a new hypha.
*   Spores are reproductive structures in filamentous fungi.

## 🥗 Nutrition

* Fungi are **chemoheterotrophs**.
* Most are **saprophytes**, meaning they obtain nutrients from dead organic matter.
* Some are **parasites**, obtaining nutrients from living hosts.
* They digest food externally by secreting enzymes and then absorbing the smaller molecules.

## ⚡️ Metabolism

Microbes use two general processes:
*   **Glycolysis**: Oxidizes glucose to pyruvic acid, produces ATP and NADH.
*   **Respiration**: Pyruvic acid $\rightarrow$ Acetyl CoA $\rightarrow$ Krebs Cycle $\rightarrow$ Electron Transport Chain. The final electron acceptor is external, usually **$O_2$**.
*   **Fermentation**: The final electron acceptor is a molecule made in the cell; pyruvic acid is incorporated into fermentation end-products.

## 🔄 Reproduction

Fungi can reproduce both asexually and sexually through the formation of spores. Spores are detached from the parent and can germinate into a new mold.

### Generalized Sexual Reproduction Cycle
Sexual reproduction in fungi occurs in three phases:
1.  **Plasmogamy**: The fusion of cytoplasm from two parent cells, resulting in a heterokaryotic stage (unfused nuclei).
2.  **Karyogamy**: The fusion of the haploid nuclei to form a diploid zygote nucleus.
3.  **Meiosis**: The diploid nucleus divides to produce haploid spores, which may be genetic recombinants.

### Asexual Spores
* Produced by an individual fungus through **mitosis**.
* **Conidiospores (Conidia)**: Unicellular or multicellular spores that are **not** enclosed in a sac. Produced at the end of a conidiophore. (e.g., *Aspergillus*, where conidia are arranged in **chains**).
    *   **Blastoconidia**: Formed by budding (e.g., *Candida*, *Cryptococcus*).
    *   **Porospore**: Spore pushed out through a small pore (e.g., ***Alternaria***).
    *   **Phialospore**: Produced from a vase-shaped cell called a phialide (e.g., *Penicillium*, *Aspergillus*).
    *   **Microconidia / Macroconidia**: Small vs. large multicelled conidia (e.g., *Microsporum*, *Fusarium*).
    *   **Arthroconidia**: Formed by the fragmentation of a septate hypha (e.g., ***Ceratocystis ulmi***).
    *   **Chlamydospores**: Thick-walled spores formed within a hypha.
* **Sporangiospores**: Formed *within* a sporangium (sac) at the end of a sporangiophore. (e.g., ***Rhizopus***, ***Absidia***).
    *   **Columella**: Domed tip of the sporangiophore inside the sporangium.
* **Zoospores**: Motile spores that use flagella for locomotion. Found in the phylum **Blastocladiomycota** (e.g., ***Allomyces***).

### Sexual Spores
* Result from the fusion of nuclei from two opposite mating strains of the same species.
*   **Note**: Sexual spores are produced less frequently than asexual spores and often require specific environmental cues or mating types (+ and -).
* **Zygospores**: Large spores enclosed in a thick, rough wall.
    *   Formed when two haploid hyphae of opposite mating types fuse (plasmogamy) to form a zygosporangium.
    *   **Life Cycle (*Rhizopus*)**: Two opposite mating strains (designated + and -) are necessary for sexual reproduction. **Progametangia** from different hyphae contact each other, resulting in each forming a gamete.
    *   This structure protects the zygote during harsh conditions (dormancy). Karyogamy and meiosis occur prior to germination.
    *   (Phylum Mucoromycota/Zygomycota).
* **Ascospores**: Formed within a sac-like structure called an **ascus**.
    *   Karyogamy and meiosis occur within the ascus, typically followed by a mitotic division to produce **8 ascospores**.
    *   Asci are often contained within a fruiting body called an **ascocarp** where ascospores are discharged.
    *   Examples: ***Talaromyces***, ***Neurospora crassa*** (produces pigmented haploid spores/conidia and can reproduce sexually).
    *   (Phylum Ascomycota).
* **Basidiospores**: Formed externally on a club-shaped structure called a **basidium**.
    *   Karyogamy and meiosis occur within the basidium to produce **4 haploid basidiospores**.
    *   These spores form at the tips of the basidium (on structures called sterigmata) and are discharged.
    *   Basidia are typically arranged on the gills or pores of a fruiting body called a **basidiocarp** (mushroom).
    *   Example: ***Itajahya galericulata***.
    *   (Phylum Basidiomycota).

## 🧬 Dimorphism

Some fungi have the ability to switch between two morphological forms: a mold (hyphal) phase and a yeast phase. This property is known as **dimorphism**.

### $CO_2$ / Oxygen-Dependent Dimorphism
*   Some fungi switch forms based on gas concentrations, specifically Oxygen ($O_2$) and Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$).
*   **Example**: ***Mucor indicus*** (and some other *Mucor* species).
    *   **Aerobic conditions (Surface of agar)**: Grows as a **filamentous mold**.
    *   **Anaerobic conditions / High $CO_2$ (Inside agar)**: Grows as a **yeast**.

## SYMBIOSIS: Lichens

* Lichens are a symbiotic association between a fungus (mycobiont) and a photosynthetic partner (photobiont), which is either a green alga or a cyanobacterium.
* The fungus provides structure and absorbs water, while the alga/cyanobacterium provides food through photosynthesis.
* **Structure**: Composed of a fungal cortex (upper and lower), an algal layer (just below the upper cortex), and a medulla (fungal hyphae).
* **Ascocarp of fungus**: A structure found in the cross-section of some lichens.
* **Soredia**: Reproductive structures consisting of fungal hyphae wrapped around algal cells.
* **Growth Forms**:
    * **Crustose** (encrusting)
    * **Foliose** (leaflike)
    * **Fruticose** (shrublike)
