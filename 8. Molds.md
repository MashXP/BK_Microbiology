# 🍄 Molds (The Fungi)

Molds are a large and taxonomically diverse number of fungal species where the growth of hyphae results in a discoloration and a fuzzy appearance, especially on food.

## 🌿 Characteristics of Fungi

* **Eukaryotic**: Have a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
* **Heterotrophic**: Obtain nutrients by absorbing them from their environment.
* **Cell Wall**: Composed of **chitin**. Also can contain glucans and mannans.
* **Body Plan**: Can be unicellular (yeasts) or multicellular (molds). Multicellular fungi are composed of filaments called **hyphae**.
* **Mycology**: The study of fungi.

## 🌳 The Body Plan of Fungi

* **Hyphae**: Long, branching, filamentous structures. A mass of hyphae is called a **mycelium**.
    * **Septate hyphae**: Contain cross-walls (septa) that divide the hyphae into distinct cells.
    * **Coenocytic (aseptate) hyphae**: Lack septa and are a continuous mass of cytoplasm with multiple nuclei.
* **Vegetative Hyphae**: The portion of the mycelium that obtains nutrients.
* **Aerial (Reproductive) Hyphae**: The portion that projects above the medium and is connected with reproduction, often bearing spores.

## 🥗 Nutrition

* Fungi are **chemoheterotrophs**.
* Most are **saprophytes**, meaning they obtain nutrients from dead organic matter.
* Some are **parasites**, obtaining nutrients from living hosts.
* They digest food externally by secreting enzymes and then absorbing the smaller molecules.

## 🔄 Reproduction

Fungi can reproduce both asexually and sexually through the formation of spores. Spores are detached from the parent and can germinate into a new mold.

### Generalized Sexual Reproduction Cycle
Sexual reproduction in fungi occurs in three phases:
1.  **Plasmogamy**: The fusion of cytoplasm from two parent cells, resulting in a heterokaryotic stage (unfused nuclei).
2.  **Karyogamy**: The fusion of the haploid nuclei to form a diploid zygote nucleus.
3.  **Meiosis**: The diploid nucleus divides to produce haploid spores, which may be genetic recombinants.

### Asexual Spores
* Produced by an individual fungus through **mitosis**.
* **Conidiospores (Conidia)**: Unicellular or multicellular spores that are **not** enclosed in a sac. Produced at the end of a conidiophore. (e.g., *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*). Other types include:
    * **Arthroconidia**: Formed by the fragmentation of a septate hypha.
    * **Chlamydospores**: Thick-walled spores formed within a hypha.
* **Sporangiospores**: Formed *within* a sporangium (sac) at the end of a sporangiophore. (e.g., *Rhizopus*).
* **Zoospores**: Motile spores that use flagella for locomotion.

### Sexual Spores
* Result from the fusion of nuclei from two opposite mating strains of the same species.
* **Zygospores**: Large spores enclosed in a thick wall. Results from the fusion of two cells that are morphologically similar. (Phylum Zygomycota).
* **Ascospores**: Formed within an **ascus** (sac). (Phylum Ascomycota).
* **Basidiospores**: Formed externally on a pedestal called a **basidium**. (Phylum Basidiomycota).

## 🗂️ Classification of Fungi

Fungi are classified into phyla based on their method of sexual reproduction.

#### 1. Zygomycota (Conjugation Fungi)
* Have coenocytic hyphae.
* Produce **sporangiospores** (asexual) and **zygospores** (sexual).
* Example: *Rhizopus stolonifer* (black bread mold).

#### 2. Ascomycota (Sac Fungi)
* Have septate hyphae.
* Produce **conidiospores** (asexual) and **ascospores** (sexual).
* Includes molds with septate hyphae and some yeasts.
* Examples: *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*, *Neurospora crassa*.

#### 3. Basidiomycota (Club Fungi)
* Have septate hyphae.
* Produce **conidiospores** (asexual) and **basidiospores** (sexual).
* Includes mushrooms, puffballs, and shelf fungi.

#### 4. Deuteromycota (Fungi Imperfecti)
* A historical "holding category" for fungi that were not known to produce sexual spores.
* Most have been reclassified into other phyla based on rRNA and genomic data.

## 🦠 Medically Important Molds

* ***Aspergillus***: An opportunistic pathogen. Can cause aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals. Also used in the production of citric acid and soy sauce.
* ***Penicillium***: The source of the antibiotic penicillin. Also used in the production of blue cheese. Some species can be pathogenic.
* ***Rhizopus***: A common bread mold. Can cause zygomycosis, a rare but serious infection.

## ☠️ Mycotoxins

* Toxins produced by fungi that can cause disease in humans and animals.
* **Aflatoxin**: Produced by *Aspergillus flavus*. It is a potent carcinogen and can be found in contaminated peanuts and other crops.
* **Ergot toxin**: Produced by *Claviceps purpurea*. Can cause hallucinations and gangrene.

## 🩺 Fungal Diseases (Mycoses)

* **Systemic mycoses**: Deep within the body, affecting multiple organs.
* **Subcutaneous mycoses**: Beneath the skin.
* **Cutaneous mycoses**: Affect hair, epidermis, and nails.
* **Superficial mycoses**: Localized on hair shafts and surface epidermal cells.
* **Opportunistic mycoses**: Caused by normal microbiota or fungi that are normally harmless but become pathogenic in a debilitated or immunocompromised host.

## SYMBIOSIS: Lichens

* Lichens are a symbiotic association between a fungus (mycobiont) and a photosynthetic partner (photobiont), which is either a green alga or a cyanobacterium.
* The fungus provides structure and absorbs water, while the alga/cyanobacterium provides food through photosynthesis.
* **Growth Forms**:
    * **Crustose** (encrusting)
    * **Foliose** (leaflike)
    * **Fruticose** (shrublike)
