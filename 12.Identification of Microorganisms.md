# 🔬 Identification of Microorganisms

Identifying unknown microorganisms is a cornerstone of microbiology, crucial for clinical diagnosis, environmental studies, and industrial applications. The methods can be broadly divided into phenotypic (classical) and genotypic (modern) approaches.

## 📖 Phenotypic Identification Methods

These methods rely on the observable characteristics of a microorganism.

### 1. Bergey's Manual of Determinative and Systematic Bacteriology

-   **Bergey's Manual** is the standard reference for bacterial classification and identification.
-   **Determinative Bacteriology (earlier editions)**: Organized bacteria based on phenotypic characteristics (morphology, staining, biochemical tests) for the purpose of identification. It was organized into four main divisions (Gram-negative, Gram-positive, other bacteria/archaea, and Actinomycetes). It did not provide a clear evolutionary history.
-   **Systematic Bacteriology (current editions)**: Organizes bacteria into phyla based on evolutionary relationships, primarily determined by **16S rRNA sequencing**. It consists of 5 volumes (Vol. 1: Archaea & Actinomycetes, Vol. 2: Proteobacteria, Vol. 3: Firmicutes, etc.).

### 2. Morphological Characteristics
-   **Cell Shape and Arrangement**: Coccus, bacillus, spiral; single, diplo, strepto, staphylo.
-   **Staining**:
    -   **Gram Stain**: Differentiates bacteria based on cell wall structure (Gram-positive vs. Gram-negative).
    -   **Acid-Fast Stain**: For identifying *Mycobacterium* and *Nocardia*.
-   **Colony Morphology**: Appearance of colonies on an agar plate (shape, color, texture).

### 3. Biochemical and Physiological Tests
-   These tests identify the metabolic capabilities of a microorganism, often presented in a **dichotomous key**.
-   **Examples**:
    -   Ability to ferment specific carbohydrates (e.g., lactose, sorbitol).
    -   Production of specific enzymes (e.g., oxidase, urease, lysine decarboxylase).
    -   Production of metabolic byproducts (e.g., H₂S, acetoin).
    -   Use of specific compounds as a sole carbon source (e.g., citrate).
-   **Rapid Identification Methods**: Commercial systems like the **EnteroPluri test** contain media for multiple biochemical tests in a single tube. After incubation, the positive and negative results are used to generate a unique numerical code (e.g., 62343), which is then compared to a database to identify the species (e.g., *Citrobacter freundii*).
-   **Cell Wall Chemistry**: Analysis of the chemical composition of the cell wall, such as the specific amino acids (e.g., meso-diaminopimelic acid vs. L-DAP) or sugars (e.g., arabinose, galactose), is a key phenotypic marker, especially for Actinomycetes.

### 4. Serology
-   Serological tests use antibodies to detect specific antigens on the surface of microorganisms.
-   This method is highly specific and can be used to differentiate between strains of the same species.

## 🧬 Genotypic Identification Methods

These methods are based on the analysis of a microorganism's genetic material (DNA or RNA). They are highly accurate and have revolutionized microbial identification and classification.

### 1. Specific Gene Sequencing
-   This is the most common genotypic method. It involves sequencing a specific gene that is conserved across different species but has enough variation to distinguish between them.
-   **Marker Genes**:
    -   **16S rRNA**: For bacteria and archaea.
    -   **23S rRNA**: Also used for bacteria.
    -   **18S rRNA** or **Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS)**: For fungi and other eukaryotes.
    -   **rpoB**: Another useful gene for bacterial identification.

### 2. The Identification Process
1.  **Primer Design and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)**:
    -   Primers are designed to bind to conserved regions of the marker gene.
    -   PCR is used to amplify a specific segment of the gene, creating millions of copies.
2.  **PCR Fragment Sequencing**:
    -   The amplified DNA fragment is sequenced to determine the exact order of its nucleotides.
3.  **Database Search (BLAST)**:
    -   The obtained sequence is entered into a public database like GenBank.
    -   The **Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)** is used to compare the sequence to all known sequences in the database to find the closest matches. The results show scores for Query Cover, E-value (Expect value), and Percent Identity.
4.  **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**:
    -   To understand the evolutionary relationship of the unknown microorganism to other species, a phylogenetic tree is constructed.
    -   This involves:
        -   **Multiple Sequence Alignment**: Aligning the sequence of the unknown with sequences from related organisms.
        -   **Choosing Evolutionary Models**: Selecting a model that best describes the evolutionary changes in the sequences.
        -   **Tree Construction**: Using methods like Maximum Likelihood or Neighbor-Joining to build the tree.
        -   **Determining Reliability**: Using statistical methods like bootstrapping to assess the confidence in the branching pattern of the tree.
