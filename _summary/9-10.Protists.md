# 🦠 Protists

Protists are a diverse group of eukaryotic microorganisms. They are a **polyphyletic** group, meaning they do not share a single common ancestor.

## 🌿 General Characteristics

* **Eukaryotic**: They have a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
* **Unicellular or Multicellular**: Most are unicellular, but some are multicellular (like algae).
* **Nutrition**: Can be **photoautotrophs**, **heterotrophs**, or **mixotrophs** (combining both).
* **Reproduction**: Can reproduce **asexually** or ** sexually** (using meiosis and fertilization).
    *   **Sexual Life Cycle Types**:
        *   **Gametic Meiosis (Animals)**: The organism is diploid (2n); meiosis produces gametes (n) directly.
        *   **Sporic Meiosis (Plants/Algae)**: Alternation of generations. Mitosis occurs in both diploid and haploid stages.
        *   **Zygotic Meiosis (Fungi/Protists)**: The organism is haploid (n); the only diploid stage is the zygote, which undergoes meiosis immediately.
* **Habitat**: Most are aquatic, living in freshwater, marine, or damp environments.

## 🗂️ Modern Classification (Eukaryotic Supergroups)

Protists are now classified into several supergroups based on DNA and morphological similarities, replacing the older "animal-like," "plant-like," and "fungus-like" system.

### 1. Supergroup Excavata
Members are defined by a unique flagellar structure or an "excavated" feeding groove.
*   **Note**: The monophyly of this supergroup has been called into question by recent genomic studies.

* **Diplomonads**:
    * **Example**: *Giardia intestinalis*.
    * **Features**:
        *   Possess two equal-sized nuclei.
        *   Have multiple flagella.
        *   Contain reduced mitochondria called **mitosomes**. These organelles lack functional ETCs and cannot use oxygen to extract energy from organic molecules. Instead, rely on anaerobic biochemical pathways for energy.
        *   Many are parasites, such as the well-known *Giardia intestinalis*, which inhabits the intestines of mammals.
    * **Life Cycle**: Ingestion of dormant **cysts** from contaminated water; they become active **trophozoites** in the intestine.
* **Parabasalids**:
    * **Example**: *Trichomonas vaginalis*.
    * **Features**: 
        * Have reduced mitochondria called **hydrogenosomes** (generate some energy anaerobically and release hydrogen gas). 
        * Move using flagella and an **undulating membrane**.
*   **Euglenozoans**:
    *   Includes predatory heterotrophs, photosynthetic autotrophs, mixotrophs, and parasites.
    *   **Features**: Distinguished by a **crystalline rod** inside their flagella.
        *   **Morphology/Life Cycle**:
            *   Elongated, often pear-shaped cell.
            *   One or two flagella protruding from a reservoir.
            *   Light-detecting apparatus:
                *   **Eyespot (Stigma)**: Shades a photoreceptor.
                *   **Photoreceptor**: Allows orientation towards light.
            *   Flexible **pellicle** covering cell surface, enabling shape changes.
            *   Many species contain **chloroplasts** for photosynthesis.
    
    *   **Kinetoplastids**:
        *   Have a single, large mitochondrion with a **kinetoplast** (a mass of DNA).
        *   Includes species that feed on prokaryotes in freshwater, marine, and moist terrestrial ecosystems.
        *   Also includes species that parasitize animals, plants, and other protists.
        *   **Examples**:
            *   *Trypanosoma brucei* (causes African Sleeping Sickness).
            *   *Trypanosoma cruzi* (causes Chagas disease).
            *   *Leishmania* (causes Leishmaniasis).
        *   **Vectors**:
            *   Tsetse fly (for *Trypanosoma brucei*).
            *   Kissing Bug (*Triatoma*) (for *Trypanosoma cruzi*).
            *   Sand Fly (*Phlebotomus*) (for *Leishmania*).
        *   **Morphological Forms of Trypanosomatids**:
            *   **Amastigote**: Round or oval, intracellular, no external flagellum (e.g., in tissue stages of *Leishmania* and *Trypanosoma cruzi*).
            *   **Promastigote**: Elongated, anterior flagellum (e.g., in insect vector of *Leishmania*).
            *   **Epimastigote**: Elongated, flagellum attached to a short undulating membrane (e.g., in insect vector of *Trypanosoma cruzi*).
            *   **Trypomastigote**: Elongated, flagellum attached to a long undulating membrane, kinetoplast posterior to nucleus (e.g., bloodstream form of *Trypanosoma brucei* and *Trypanosoma cruzi*).
    *   **Euglenids**: e.g., *Euglena* (Mixotrophs with an eyespot).
        * Commonly found in pond water.
        *   **Pellicle**: A flexible protein layer beneath the plasma membrane that provides strength and flexibility (allows shape change).
        *   **Eyespot (Stigma)**: Pigmented organelle that acts as a shield for the light detector.
        *   **Light Detector**: A swelling near the flagellum base that actually detects light. The interaction between the two allows the organism to orient toward light.
        *   **Contractile vacuole**: Expels excess water.
*   **Percolozoa**:
    * **Example**: *Naegleria fowleri*.
    * **Details**: Known as the "brain-eating amoeba." Found in warm freshwater; enters through the nose causing primary amebic meningoencephalitis.
    * **Morphology**: In electron micrographs, the attachment and feeding structures give it a distinct "face-like" appearance (often described as having "eyes" and a "mouth").

### 2. Supergroup SAR

* A highly diverse group named for its three clades: Stramenopila, Alveolata, and Rhizaria.
* Defined by DNA similarities

* **Stramenopiles**:
    *   **Diatoms**:
        *   Unicellular algae with a two-part, glass-like wall made of **silica** (a frustule).
        *   **Reproduction**: Asexual reproduction causes cells to get progressively smaller. Sexual reproduction (auxospore formation) is required to restore the original size.
    *   **Brown Algae**:
        *   Multicellular algae (kelp).
        *   **Thallus Structure**: (The algal body, lacks true roots/stems/leaves)
            *   **Holdfast**: Root-like structure that anchors the alga.
            *   **Stipe**: Stem-like structure.
            *   **Blade**: Leaf-like structure for photosynthesis.
        *   **Life Cycle (Alternation of Generations)**:
            *   Alternates between a large, multicellular diploid **sporophyte** (the familiar kelp plant) and a much smaller, often microscopic, multicellular haploid **gametophyte**.
            *   Sporophyte produces spores via meiosis, which develop into gametophytes.
            *   Gametophytes produce gametes that fuse to form a zygote, which grows into a new sporophyte.
            *   In heteromorphic species like *Laminaria*, the sporophyte and gametophyte look distinctly different.
            *   **Laminaria**: Heteromorphic alternation of generations (sporophyte and gametophyte look different).
            *   **Ectocarpus**: Isomorphic alternation of generations (sporophyte and gametophyte look similar).
                *   **Plurilocular Sporangia**: Produce spores via mitosis (2n → 2n) that develop into more sporophytes.
                *   **Unilocular Sporangia**: Produce spores via meiosis (2n → n) that develop into gametophytes.
    *   **Oomycetes (Water Molds)**:
        *   Fungus-like protists, but with **cellulose** cell walls. Includes *Phytophthora*.
        *   **Examples**:
            *   *Phytophthora infestans*: Causes late blight of potatoes (responsible for the Irish Potato Famine).
            *   *Phytophthora capsici*: Infects peppers.
        *   **Life Cycle**:
            *   **Asexual Reproduction**:
                *   Encysted zoospores germinate and form hyphae.
                *   Hyphae develop tubular **zoosporangia** at their ends.
                *   Zoosporangia produce biflagellated, diploid (2n) **zoospores** which are released to spread.
            *   **Sexual Reproduction**:
                *   Hyphae form sexual structures: **oogonia** (containing eggs) and **antheridial hyphae** (containing sperm nuclei).
                *   Meiosis occurs within these structures to produce haploid (n) gametes.
                *   Antheridial hyphae grow around oogonia; **fertilization** occurs when sperm nuclei are deposited via tubes into eggs.
                *   Formation of thick-walled, dormant, diploid (2n) **zygotes (oospores)**.
                *   After dormancy, zygotes germinate to form new hyphae.
* **Alveolates**:
    * **Features**: Have **alveoli** (membrane-enclosed sacs) beneath the plasma membrane.
    *   **Dinoflagellates**: Unicellular; possess two flagella located in grooves (transverse and longitudinal), causing them to spin as they move through water. Blooms can cause toxic "red tides".
        *   **Examples**: *Pfiesteria shumwayae* (can cause fish kills) and *Alexandrium* (associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning).
    *   **Apicomplexans**: Parasites of animals.
        *   **Life Cycle (e.g., *Plasmodium*)**:
            *   Often involves two hosts and both asexual and sexual reproduction.
            *   **In Human Host**:
                *   Infected mosquito injects haploid **sporozoites**.
                *   Sporozoites travel to the liver, multiply asexually into **merozoites**.
                *   Merozoites infect red blood cells, multiplying further and causing cycles of fever and chills.
                *   Some merozoites develop into **gametocytes**.
            *   **In Mosquito Host**:
                *   Gametocytes are taken up by a mosquito during a blood meal.
                *   Sexual reproduction (fusion of gametes, meiosis) occurs within the mosquito.
                *   Produces new sporozoites that migrate to the salivary glands, completing the cycle.
        *   **Examples**: *Plasmodium* (causes malaria), *Toxoplasma gondii* (associated with cats/congenital risk), *Cryptosporidium* (waterborne diarrhea), and *Babesia* (tick vector).        *   **Features**: Named for their **apical complex**, used to penetrate host cells.
        *   **Vector**: *Anopheles* mosquito.
        *   **Life Cycle Stages**:
            -   **Sporozoite**: The infectious stage injected by the mosquito.
            -   **Merozoite**: The stage that infects red blood cells.
            -   **Gametocyte**: The form picked up by a mosquito to continue the cycle.
        *   **Life Cycle**: Asexual reproduction (merozoites) in human liver and red blood cells; sexual reproduction in *Anopheles* mosquitoes.
    *   **Ciliates**:
        *   **Examples**: *Paramecium*, *Balantidium coli* (the only ciliate parasitic to humans, causes dysentery).
        *   **Features**: Use **cilia** for movement and feeding.
        *   **Pellicle**: A flexible protein layer beneath the plasma membrane that provides strength and flexibility (allows shape change).
        *   **Macronucleus**: Controls everyday functions (feeding, waste, water balance).
            *   **Contractile Vacuole**: Organelle that pumps out excess water to prevent lysis (osmoregulation).
            *   **Micronucleus**: Involved in sexual reproduction (conjugation).
        *   **Reproduction**: Reproduce sexually via **conjugation**, where two cells align and swap haploid micronuclei.
*   **Rhizarians**:
    *   **Features**: Amoebas with threadlike pseudopodia.
    *   **Radiolarians**: Have delicate internal skeletons made of **Silica** ($SiO_2$).
    *   **Foraminiferans (Forams)**: Have porous shells, or "tests," made of **Calcium Carbonate** ($CaCO_3$).
        *   **Climate Science Use**: Researchers measure Magnesium content in fossils to estimate ancient ocean temperatures (warm water = high Mg).
        *   **Life Cycle Stages**: Exhibit alternation of generations between two distinct forms:
            *   **Schizont**: The microspheric (small initial chamber), multinucleate, diploid (2n) asexual generation.
            *   **Gamont**: The megalospheric (large initial chamber), uninucleate, haploid (n) sexual generation.
    *   **Cercozoans**:
        *   **Example**: *Paulinella chromatophora*.
        *   **Significance**: It conducts photosynthesis using a chromatophore derived from a different cyanobacterium than the one that became the plastid in all other plants, representing a unique primary endosymbiosis event.
        *   **Chlorarachniophytes**: Mixotrophs (e.g., *Lotharella*) that originated via secondary endosymbiosis by engulfing a green alga.

## 🆚 Distinguishing Characteristics:

*   **Protozoa**: Chemoheterotrophs, unicellular, no cell wall, vegetative form is a trophozoite.
*   **Algae**: Photoautotrophs, can be multicellular, have cell walls (cellulose/silica), pigments.
*   **Fungi**: Chemoheterotrophs, multicellular (except yeast), chitin cell walls, non-motile.

*   **Opisthokonts**: A diverse group that includes animals, fungi, and several groups of protists.
    *   **Nucleariids**: Protists that are closely related to fungi.
    *   **Choanoflagellates**: Protists that are the closest living relatives of animals.

*   **Amoebozoans**:
    *   **Features**: Amoebas with **lobe- or tube-shaped pseudopodia**.
        *   **Morphology/Life Cycle**:
            *   Single-celled organism that lacks a fixed shape, constantly changing.
            *   Extends and retracts broad, blunt **pseudopodia** (false feet) for movement and engulfing food particles (**phagocytosis**).
            *   Pseudopodia are characteristic lobe- or tube-shaped structures.
            *   Reproduction is primarily asexual through **binary fission**.
            *   **Slime Molds**: Exhibit more complex life cycles involving either a large multinucleate plasmodium or aggregation of individual cells into a "slug" for dispersal.
    *   **Slime Molds (Mycetozoans)**: "Fungus-animals".
        *   **Plasmodial Slime Molds**: The feeding stage is a **plasmodium**—a single, large, multinucleate mass of cytoplasm. It forms sporangia (fruiting bodies) to produce spores.
            *   **Structure**: The plasmodium is a product of mitosis without cytokinesis, resulting in one large cell with many diploid nuclei.
            *   **Appearance**: Often brightly colored, usually yellow or orange.
        *   **Cellular Slime Molds**: Example: *Dictyostelium*. Solitary haploid amoebas are the feeding stage. When food is scarce, cells **aggregate** to form a "slug" and a fruiting body. The cells remain as individual cells in the aggregate. While usually haploid, they can reproduce sexually by forming a large diploid Zygote (Giant Cell) which consumes other haploid amoebas before undergoing meiosis.
    *   **Entamoebas**: Parasitic amoebas, such as *Entamoeba histolytica*.
    *   **Other Pathogenic Amoebozoans**:
        *   *Acanthamoeba* (causes Keratitis in eyes).
