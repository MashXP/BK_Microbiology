# 🧪 Penicillin Production

Penicillin was one of the first antibiotics to be discovered and is still widely used to treat bacterial infections. It is produced through a large-scale fermentation process using a mold.

## 🔬 Introduction to Penicillin

* **Discovery**: Discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928 from the mold *Penicillium notatum*. His original strain produced what is now known as **Penicillin-F**.
* **Production Strain**: Modern production uses high-yielding strains of ***Penicillium chrysogenum***, which is more suitable for submerged fermentation.
* **Chemical Structure**: The core of the penicillin molecule is **6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA)**, which consists of a thiazolidine ring and a condensed β-lactam ring. The β-lactam ring is responsible for its antibacterial activity.
* **Types of Penicillin**:
    -   **Natural Penicillins**: Produced directly by the mold. The type depends on the side-chain precursor available in the medium (e.g., Penicillin G, Penicillin V, Penicillin K, Penicillin F).
    -   **Semi-synthetic Penicillins**: Created by chemically modifying the 6-APA nucleus obtained from fermentation. This allows for the creation of penicillins with improved characteristics, such as acid stability (for oral administration, e.g., Amoxicillin, Ampicillin) and resistance to bacterial β-lactamase enzymes (e.g., Methicillin, Cloxacillin).

## 🧬 Biosynthesis of Penicillin

Penicillin is a secondary metabolite, meaning it is produced by the mold after the primary growth phase. The biosynthesis is a non-ribosomal process involving the condensation of three amino acids:

1.  L-α-aminoadipic acid (AAA)
2.  L-cysteine
3.  L-valine

These three amino acids are condensed to form a tripeptide (LLD-Tripeptide), which is then cyclized to form **isopenicillin N**. This is the first key intermediate. Finally, the α-aminoadipyl side chain of isopenicillin N is exchanged for another side chain (e.g., phenylacetic acid for Penicillin G) by the enzyme penicillin transacetylase.

## 🏭 The Fermentation Process

Penicillin is produced commercially using a **fed-batch submerged fermentation** process in large, stirred-tank fermenters (40,000 to 200,000 liters). The process is highly aerobic, requiring an oxygen absorption rate of 0.4-0.8 mm/min and an aeration rate of 0.5-1.0 vvm (volumes of air per volume of medium per minute).

### 1. Strain Development (Strain Improvement)
* The original wild-type *P. chrysogenum* produced very low yields of penicillin.
* High-yielding strains have been developed through a process of sequential genetic selection.
* This involves exposing the mold to mutagens (like UV radiation, X-rays, or nitrogen mustard gas) and then selecting for mutants that produce higher amounts of penicillin. This has resulted in a several thousand-fold increase in yield compared to the original strain.

### 2. Inoculum Production
* A high-yielding strain of *P. chrysogenum* is grown to produce a large number of spores (e.g., on wheat bran for 5-7 days).
* Spores are suspended in water or a nontoxic wetting agent (like 1:10000 sodium lauryl sulfate) because they are hydrophobic.
* This spore suspension is used to inoculate a seed tank, where it grows into a heavy mycelial culture over 24-48 hours at 24-27°C with agitation and aeration.

### 3. Inoculation and Production
* The mycelial inoculum from the seed tank is transferred to the large production fermenter.
* The fermentation runs for 120-180 hours at a controlled temperature of 25-27°C.
* **Medium Composition**:
    -   **Carbon Source**: **Lactose** is commonly used because it is metabolized slowly, which is ideal for the production phase. **Glucose** is used for the initial growth phase.
    -   **Nitrogen Source**: **Corn-steep liquor** is a key ingredient as it provides nitrogen and other essential growth factors. Ammonium sulfate or acetate can also be used.
    -   **Precursor**: A side-chain precursor (e.g., **phenylacetic acid** for Penicillin G) is fed into the fermenter during the production phase.
    -   **Other Nutrients**: Phosphorus, magnesium, sulfur, and trace elements are also required.
* **Fed-Batch Process**: Nutrients and precursors are fed continuously or intermittently during the fermentation to maintain optimal conditions for penicillin production after the initial growth phase is complete.

## 💧 Extraction and Purification

After fermentation, the penicillin must be separated from the mycelium and purified.

1.  **Separation of Mycelium**: The fermentation broth is passed through a **rotary vacuum filter** to separate the liquid medium (containing the penicillin) from the fungal mycelium.
2.  **Solvent Extraction**:
    -   The pH of the filtered liquid is lowered to **2.0-2.5** with an acid (like phosphoric or sulfuric acid). This converts the penicillin into its anionic (acid) form.
    -   The penicillin is then immediately extracted into an organic solvent like **amyl acetate** or **butyl acetate**. This is done quickly as penicillin is unstable at low pH.
    -   The penicillin is then back-extracted into water by adding a base (like potassium hydroxide) to raise the pH to **7.0-7.5**, converting it back to a water-soluble salt.
    -   This process of shifting the penicillin between the aqueous and solvent phases is repeated to purify it.
3.  **Crystallization and Final Processing**:
    -   The purified penicillin salt solution is treated with **charcoal** to remove pyrogens (fever-causing substances).
    -   It is sterilized by filtration (e.g., using a **Seitz filter**).
    -   The final penicillin salt (e.g., sodium or potassium penicillin) is obtained in crystalline form by crystallization and vacuum drying.
    -   The final product is packed as a sterile powder or formulated into tablets or syrups.

## 💊 Uses of Penicillin

* Penicillin is a **bactericidal** antibiotic, meaning it kills bacteria.
* It works by **inhibiting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall**, specifically by preventing the cross-linking of peptidoglycan. This weakens the cell wall and leads to cell lysis.
* It is most effective against **Gram-positive bacteria**.
