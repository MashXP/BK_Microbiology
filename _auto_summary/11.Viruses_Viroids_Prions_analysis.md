**Content Description:**
This page displays a comprehensive flowchart illustrating the multiplication process of various types of animal RNA viruses. It details the unique replication strategies for single-stranded RNA (+ sense and - sense) and double-stranded RNA viruses, using different colored boxes to delineate the pathways.

**Visible Text and Diagram Details:**

**Header:**
Multiplication of animal RNA viruses

**Diagram Details:**
The diagram shows a central host cell with a nucleus and cytoplasm, surrounded by a multi-branched replication cycle. The general steps of viral infection are shown externally, while the specific replication mechanisms for different RNA virus types are detailed within colored boxes.

**General Viral Cycle (Outer blue lines, common to all):**

1.  **Attachment:**
    *   **Image:** A virus particle (labeled "RNA", "Capsid") attaches to the "Host cell".
    *   **Label:** "1 Attachment"
2.  **Entry and uncoating:**
    *   **Image:** The virus enters the cell, and its capsid disassembles, releasing "Viral RNA" and "Viral protein" into the cytoplasm.
    *   **Label:** "2 Entry and uncoating"
3.  **Maturation and release:**
    *   **Image:** New virions are assembled and released from the cell.
    *   **Label:** "5 Maturation and release"

**Specific Replication Pathways (Internal colored boxes):**

**Red Box (Picornaviridae, Togaviridae - + sense ssRNA):**
*   **Initial State:** "Uncoating releases viral RNA and proteins." (Points from general step 2). The RNA is labeled "~, or sense, strand; Picornaviridae."
*   **Path 1 (Translation):** "Translation and synthesis of viral proteins." The + strand RNA acts directly as mRNA, leading to the synthesis of "Capsid protein" and "RNA-dependent RNA polymerase."
*   **Path 2 (Replication):** "RNA replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase."
    *   The "+" strand viral genome is used as a template to transcribe a "-" viral genome.
    *   From the "-" viral genome, new "+" strands are transcribed. These new "+" strands can then serve as mRNA for protein synthesis or as genomic RNA for new virions.
    *   **Text Box:** "The + strand (mRNA) must first be transcribed from the - viral genome before proteins can be synthesized." (This appears to be a mislabeling for Picornaviridae, as +RNA acts directly as mRNA. It might refer to the template synthesis for new +RNA genomes).
*   **Assembly:** "Capsid protein" combines with newly synthesized "+" strands to form new virions, which proceed to "Maturation and release."

**Blue Box (Rhabdoviridae - - sense ssRNA):**
*   **Initial State:** "Uncoating releases viral RNA and proteins." (Points from general step 2). The RNA is labeled "~, or antisense, strand; Rhabdoviridae."
*   **Transcription:** The "-" strand is transcribed into "+" strand mRNA by a viral enzyme (RNA polymerase). This mRNA then moves to the cytoplasm.
*   **Translation:** "mRNA is transcribed from the – strand." This mRNA is translated into "Capsid protein" and "RNA-dependent RNA polymerase."
*   **Replication:** "Additional – strands are transcribed from mRNA." These new "-" strands are used as genomic RNA.
*   **Assembly:** "Capsid proteins" combine with new "-" strands to form new virions, which proceed to "Maturation and release."

**Orange Box (Reoviridae - dsRNA):**
*   **Initial State:** "Uncoating releases viral RNA and proteins." (Points from general step 2). The RNA is labeled "dsRNA; +, or sense, strand with –, or antisense, strand; Reoviridae."
*   **Transcription/Translation:** "mRNA is produced inside the capsid and released into the cytoplasm of the host." This mRNA leads to "Translation and synthesis of viral proteins" (Capsid proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase).
*   **Replication:** "RNA polymerase initiates production of – strands. The mRNA and – strands form the dsRNA that is incorporated as new viral genome." (This occurs within newly forming capsids).
*   **Assembly:** "Capsid proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase" combine with new dsRNA to form new virions, which proceed to "Maturation and release."

**KEY (Bottom left):**
*   ~, or sense, strand of viral genome
*   ~, or antisense, strand of viral genome
*   ss = single-stranded
*   ds = double-stranded

    *   **Integration (Step 3b):** If the lysogenic pathway is chosen, the circular phage DNA integrates into the "Bacterial chromosome" through recombination, becoming a "Prophage."
    *   **Bacterial Reproduction (Step 4b):** The bacterial cell, now containing the integrated prophage, reproduces normally through binary fission. "Many cell divisions" are shown, with each daughter cell inheriting a copy of the bacterial chromosome that includes the prophage. This creates a population of "Lysogenic bacterium."
    *   **Excision and Lytic Cycle Initiation (Top Right - Step 5):** Occasionally, the prophage DNA can excise itself from the bacterial chromosome via another recombination event. This excision can then initiate the lytic cycle, as indicated by an arrow pointing back towards the synthesis/assembly stage of the lytic cycle.

The diagram effectively uses arrows to show the flow of events and labels like "Lytic cycle" and "Lysogenic cycle" to delineate the distinct pathways.

### Page 36

**Detailed Description:**

*   **Image:** The central part of the page is dominated by a Transmission Electron Micrograph (TEM) showing a yellowish-brown, granular background. Within this texture, two distinct, thin, thread-like structures are visible.
    *   One structure, marked by an arrow originating from the label "PSTV", is relatively long and appears somewhat linear with a slight curvature and some internal folding or coiling.
    *   Another structure, located above and slightly to the left of the first, appears more compact and possibly circular or tightly coiled, though less clearly delineated by an arrow.
*   **Labels/Scale:**
    *   A black arrow points from the text "PSTV" (Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid) to the longer, linear-appearing structure.
    *   Below the image, a red rectangular box contains the text "TEM", indicating the type of microscopy used.
    *   Adjacent to the "TEM" box, a black horizontal scale bar is provided, with the measurement "20 nm" written below it. This indicates the extremely small size of the depicted structures.
*   **Caption/Figure Title:** Below the image, in a red, bold font, is "Figure 13.22". Following this, in black bold font, is "Linear and circular potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV)." This caption clarifies that the image displays both linear and circular forms of PSTV.
*   **Question:** At the bottom of the page, preceded by a red "Q", is the question: "How do viroids differ from prions?" This question suggests a comparison between viroids and prions will be a topic of discussion or a point for the audience to consider.

**Summary of Content:** This page visually introduces the Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid (PSTV) through an electron micrograph, showing its minuscule size (20 nm scale bar) and suggesting it can exist in both linear and circular forms. The accompanying question hints at a subsequent discussion comparing viroids with prions, setting up a context for understanding these unique infectious agents.

### Page 37

**Detailed Description:**

*   **Header/Design:** The top of the page features a decorative, abstract band composed of wavy, overlapping colorful stripes (red, orange, yellow, green, blue), against a black background. There is no explicit text header.
*   **Body Text (Bullet Points):** The main content consists of five bullet points, each preceded by a green checkmark symbol (✓), describing the characteristics of viroids. Key terms are highlighted in different colors (red, orange, green, purple, yellow).

    *   **Bullet 1:** "✓ Short pieces of **naked RNA**, only 300 to 400 nucleotides long, with **no protein coat**." (Keywords "naked RNA" and "no protein coat" are in red/orange bold font.) This describes the fundamental composition and size of viroids.
    *   **Bullet 2:** "✓ The nucleotides are often internally paired, so the molecule has a **closed, folded, three-dimensional structure** that presumably helps protect it from destruction by cellular enzymes." (Keywords "closed, folded, three-dimensional structure" are in red/orange bold font.) This explains how viroids maintain their integrity despite lacking a protein coat.
    *   **Bullet 3:** "✓ Some viroids, called **virusoids**, are enclosed in a protein coat. Virusoids cause disease only when the cell is infected by a virus." (The keyword "virusoids" is in green bold font.) This bullet introduces a related entity, "virusoids," differentiating them by their protein coat (a characteristic not typically associated with classic viroids themselves) and their requirement for a helper virus for disease manifestation.
    *   **Bullet 4:** "✓**Viroids** and **virusoids** are **replicated continuously** by **host RNA polymerase** in the cell nucleus or chloroplasts." (Keywords "Viroids", "virusoids", "replicated continuously", and "host RNA polymerase" are in yellow/green bold font.) This explains the mechanism and location of replication for both viroids and virusoids, emphasizing their reliance on the host's machinery.
    *   **Bullet 5:** "✓The viroid RNA is a ribozyme that **cuts the continuous RNA** into **viroid segments**. The RNA **doesn't code for any proteins** and may cause disease by gene silencing." (Keywords "cuts the continuous RNA", "viroid segments", and "doesn't code for any proteins" are in green/purple bold font.) This describes the catalytic function of viroid RNA and highlights that viroids do not produce proteins, instead causing disease through mechanisms like gene silencing.

**Summary of Content:** This page provides a comprehensive textual overview of viroids, detailing their structure (short, naked, folded RNA), replication strategy (host RNA polymerase-dependent), and pathogenicity (ribozyme activity, gene silencing, no protein coding). It also introduces "virusoids" as related entities that are enclosed in a protein coat and require a helper virus.

### Page 38

**Detailed Description:**

*   **Header:** The top of the page features the same decorative colorful band as Page 2. Below this, the main header in white text is "Cadang-cadang (Philippines)". This identifies a specific disease and its geographic origin.
*   **Image:** A large, vertical rectangular image occupies the center of the page. It depicts a landscape filled with numerous palm trees under a bright sky.
    *   Many of the palm trees appear tall and slender. Some have green fronds at the top, while others show signs of severe distress, with sparse, withered, or entirely absent fronds, leaving only bare trunks. This suggests a widespread impact of a disease on the palm tree population.
*   **Text Below Image:** Below the image, in yellow text, is the taxonomic classification of the causative agent:
    *   "Family: Pospiviroidae"
    *   "Genus: Cocadviroid"
    *   "Species: Coconut cadang-cadang viroid"

**Summary of Content:** This page introduces "Cadang-cadang," a disease prevalent in the Philippines, which affects coconut palm trees. The image visually demonstrates the severe impact of the disease on a grove of palm trees, showing defoliation and dead trunks. The text explicitly identifies the disease's causative agent as the Coconut cadang-cadang viroid, classifying it within the Family Pospiviroidae and Genus Cocadviroid.

### Page 39

**Detailed Description:**

*   **Header:** The top of the page again features the decorative colorful band. Below this, the header in white text is "Cadang-cadang". This continues the topic from the previous page.
*   **Image:** A prominent horizontal rectangular image in the center of the page is split into two side-by-side sections, demonstrating a comparison.
    *   **Left Section:** Shows a cluster of several green coconuts, appearing plump and healthy. One coconut at the bottom is cut open, revealing a pristine white inner flesh and shell.
    *   **Right Section:** Shows a similar cluster of coconuts, but these appear discolored (brownish, mottled), possibly shriveled or diseased. One coconut at the bottom is cut open, revealing a discolored, possibly brownish or decayed inner flesh and shell, contrasting sharply with the healthy one.
    *   **Labels:** Below the left cluster, in a white box with a black border, is the label "Healthy". Below the right cluster, in a similar white box, is the label "Diseased". These labels clearly distinguish the condition of the coconuts in each section.

**Summary of Content:** This page visually illustrates the devastating effects of Cadang-cadang disease on coconuts themselves. Through a clear side-by-side comparison, it contrasts healthy, green, and intact coconuts with diseased ones, which appear discolored and show internal damage, making the impact of the viroid on the fruit evident.

### Page 43

*   **Description:** This page illustrates the initial stages of prion protein conversion and interaction within a cell using a four-panel diagram.
*   **Background:** The slide has the standard black background with the colorful wavy borders at the top and bottom. The central area is dominated by the scientific diagram.
*   **Diagram Content:** The diagram shows four circular representations of a cell, each depicting a step in the prion conversion process.
    *   **General Cell Representation:** Each cell is shown as a yellow-orange circle, representing the cytoplasm and cell membrane. Inside, a purple oval with wavy lines likely represents the nucleus or the site of protein synthesis.
    *   **PrP^c^ (Normal Prion Protein):** Represented by a wavy green line ending in a blue diamond shape. These are shown being secreted or located on the cell surface.
    *   **PrP^Sc^ (Scrapie Prion Protein / Abnormal Prion):** Represented by a brown, C-shaped molecule. These are shown primarily on the cell surface.

    *   **Panel 1 (Top Left):**
        *   **Image:** Shows a cell where the wavy green line (PrP^c^) is being synthesized and secreted towards the cell surface. Several blue diamond shapes are visible on the outer surface, and the wavy green line with its blue diamond end is explicitly labeled "PrP^c^".
        *   **Text:** "1 PrP^c^ produced by cells is secreted to the cell surface." (Numbered "1" in blue)

    *   **Panel 2 (Top Right):**
        *   **Image:** Depicts a cell with multiple brown, C-shaped PrP^Sc^ molecules present on its surface. One C-shaped molecule above the cell is specifically labeled "PrP^Sc^". The internal PrP^c^ synthesis pathway (wavy green line) is also visible.
        *   **Text:** "2 PrP^Sc^ may be acquired or produced by an altered PrP^c^ gene." (Numbered "2" in blue)

    *   **Panel 3 (Bottom Left):**
        *   **Image:** Shows a cell where an incoming brown, C-shaped PrP^Sc^ molecule is physically interacting with a normal PrP^c^ molecule (wavy green line with blue diamond) located on the cell surface.
        *   **Text:** "3 PrP^Sc^ reacts with PrP^c^ on the cell surface." (Numbered "3" in blue)

    *   **Panel 4 (Bottom Right):**
        *   **Image:** Illustrates the conversion process. The PrP^Sc^ molecule (brown C-shape) has induced a conformational change in an adjacent PrP^c^ molecule, converting it into another PrP^Sc^ molecule. More brown C-shaped molecules are now visible on the cell surface.
        *   **Text:** "4 PrP^Sc^ converts the PrP^c^ to PrP^Sc^." (Numbered "4" in blue)

### Page 44

*   **Description:** This page continues the multi-panel illustration from Page 3, showing the accumulation, cellular uptake, and eventual impact of prions on the cell, leading to cell death.
*   **Background:** The slide maintains the standard black background with the colorful wavy borders at the top and bottom. The central area is dominated by the scientific diagram.
*   **Diagram Content:** This diagram builds upon the previous page, continuing the numbered steps.
    *   **PrP^c^ (Normal Prion Protein):** Wavy green line with a blue diamond.
    *   **PrP^Sc^ (Abnormal Prion):** Brown, C-shaped molecule.
    *   **Endosome:** An intracellular vesicle formed by the invagination of the cell membrane, containing engulfed material.
    *   **Lysosome:** An organelle responsible for waste breakdown and cellular digestion, often fusing with endosomes.

    *   **Panel 5 (Top Left):**
        *   **Image:** Shows the cell surface with an increasing number of brown C-shaped PrP^Sc^ molecules. An arrow indicates that a new PrP^Sc^ molecule is converting another PrP^c^ molecule.
        *   **Text:** "5 The new PrP^Sc^ converts more PrP^c^." (Numbered "5" in blue)

    *   **Panel 6 (Top Right):**
        *   **Image:** Depicts the cell membrane undergoing endocytosis, where it invaginates to engulf some of the surface-bound PrP^Sc^ molecules, taking them into the cell's interior.
        *   **Text:** "6 The new PrP^Sc^ is taken in, possibly by receptor-mediated endocytosis." (Numbered "6" in blue)

    *   **Panel 7 (Bottom Left):**
        *   **Image:** Shows an intracellular vesicle, specifically labeled "Endosome," containing several brown C-shaped PrP^Sc^ molecules. An arrow also suggests that some PrP^Sc^ from the endosome might be transferred back to the cell surface.
        *   **Text:** "7 PrP^Sc^ accumulates in endosomes. Some may be transferred back to the cell surface." (Numbered "7" in blue)

    *   **Panel 8 (Bottom Right):**
        *   **Image:** Illustrates the further fate of PrP^Sc^ within the cell. Endosomes containing PrP^Sc^ are shown interacting with or fusing into larger vesicles labeled "Lysosome." PrP^Sc^ molecules are visible within these lysosomes. Arrows indicate accumulation and potential continued cycling to the cell surface or degradation pathways leading to cellular damage.
        *   **Text:** "8 PrP^Sc^ continues to accumulate as the endosome contents are returned to the cell surface or are transferred to lysosomes. The result is cell death." (Numbered "8" in blue)
