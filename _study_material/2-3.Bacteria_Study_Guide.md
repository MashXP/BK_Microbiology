# 🦠 Study Guide: Bacteria and Archaea

## 🚀 Executive Summary
This guide covers the fundamental characteristics of prokaryotic cells, focusing on the domains **Bacteria** and **Archaea**. It details their diverse morphologies, complex structural components (like the cell wall and flagella), and the specialized mechanisms they use for movement and genetic exchange. Understanding the differences between **Gram-positive** and **Gram-negative** cell walls is a cornerstone of this topic and essential for clinical microbiology.

## 🔑 Key Terminology Table

| Term | Definition | Real-World Example/Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prokaryote** | Unicellular organism lacking a membrane-bound nucleus or organelles. | Like an open-plan studio apartment (everything in one room). |
| **Peptidoglycan** | A mesh-like polymer of sugars and amino acids that forms bacterial cell walls. | Like a chain-link fence providing structural support. |
| **Binary Fission** | The primary method of asexual reproduction in prokaryotes. | One "parent" cell splitting into two identical "daughters." |
| **Glycocalyx** | A sugar-coat (capsule or slime layer) external to the cell wall. | Like a sticky invisibility cloak or a suit of armor. |
| **Chemotaxis** | Movement of a cell toward or away from a chemical stimulus. | Following the smell of pizza (positive) or avoiding smoke (negative). |
| **Plasmid** | Small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA that often carries "bonus" genes. | Like a specialized "cheat code" for antibiotic resistance. |
| **Endospore** | A highly resistant, dormant structure formed for survival under stress. | Like a microbial "panic room" or time capsule. |

## 🧠 Core Concepts (The Deep Dive)

### 1. The Three-Domain System
All life is classified into three domains based on ribosomal RNA similarities:
*   **Bacteria:** Prokaryotic, contains peptidoglycan in cell walls.
*   **Archaea:** Prokaryotic, cell walls lack peptidoglycan, often live in extreme environments.
*   **Eukarya:** Eukaryotic, includes animals, plants, fungi, and protists.

### 2. Cell Morphology (Shapes & Arrangements)
Bacteria are defined by their shape and how they group together.
*   **Basic Shapes:** 
    *   **Cocci:** Spherical.
    *   **Bacilli:** Rod-shaped.
    *   **Spiral:** Wavy or corkscrew (Vibrio, Spirillum, Spirochete).
*   **Unusual Shapes:**
    *   **Star-shaped:** Genus *Stella*.
    *   **Square/Flat:** Genus *Haloarcula* (often extreme halophilic archaea).
*   **Arrangements (Cocci):**
    *   **Diplococci:** Pairs.
    *   **Streptococci:** Chains.
    *   **Tetrads:** Groups of four.
    *   **Sarcinae:** Cubes of eight.
    *   **Staphylococci:** Clusters (like grapes).

### 3. Visualizing the Invisible (Microscopy)
Understanding size is relative to the tool used:
*   **Unaided Eye:** Up to ~100 µm (Chicken/Frog eggs).
*   **Light Microscopy (LM):** Resolves down to **200 nm** (most bacteria).
*   **Super-resolution Microscopy:** Spans **10 nm to 1 µm**.
*   **Electron Microscopy (EM):** Resolves down to **0.1 nm** (viruses, proteins, atoms).

### 4. The Bacterial Cell Wall: Gram-Positive vs. Gram-Negative
The cell wall prevents osmotic lysis and is the basis for the Gram stain.

| Feature | Gram-Positive | Gram-Negative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Peptidoglycan** | Thick, multi-layered (sensitive to **Lysozyme**). | Thin, single layer. |
| **Outer Membrane** | Absent. | Present (contains LPS). |
| **Teichoic Acids** | Present (Lipoteichoic/Wall). | Absent. |
| **LPS (Endotoxin)** | Absent. | Present (**Lipid A**). |
| **Porins** | Absent. | Present (channels for nutrients/drugs). |
| **Gram Stain Color** | **Purple** (retains crystal violet). | **Pink/Red** (retains safranin). |

> **The Penicillin Rule:**
> Penicillin inactivates **transpeptidase**, the enzyme that builds **peptide cross-bridges** between NAG and NAM units. This weakens the wall, causing osmotic lysis.

### 5. Specialized External Structures
*   **Flagella:** Locomotion. Consist of a **filament (flagellin), hook, and basal body**.
    *   *Arrangements:* Peritrichous (all over), Monotrichous (one end), Lophotrichous (tuft), Amphitrichous (both ends).
    *   *Swarming:* **Proteus** cells can have >1000 flagella for coordinated surface movement.
*   **Axial Filaments (Endoflagella):** Found in **spirochetes** (*Treponema pallidum*).
*   **Fimbriae:** Used for **attachment** (e.g., *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*).
*   **Pili (Sex Pili):** Longer than fimbriae; facilitate **DNA transfer** (conjugation).

### 6. Internal Structures & Genetic Exchange
*   **Nucleoid:** Large circular chromosome. Origin of mitochondria/chloroplasts linked to Proteobacteria/Cyanobacteria via **Endosymbiosis**.
*   **Inclusions (Storage):**
    *   **Volutin:** Inorganic phosphate.
    *   **Magnetosomes:** Iron oxide ($Fe_3O_4$) for orientation.
    *   **Carboxysomes:** $CO_2$ fixation.
*   **Horizontal Gene Transfer:**
    1.  **Transformation:** Taking up "naked" DNA.
    2.  **Conjugation:** Transfer of plasmids (e.g., **R factors** for antibiotic resistance) via a sex pilus and mating bridge.
*   **Endospores:** Survival structures (*Bacillus anthracis*). Process: **Sporulation** (forespore formation) -> **Germination** (return to vegetative state).

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
*   **Gram Stain Steps:** Forgetting the order (Crystal Violet -> Iodine -> Alcohol -> Safranin). The **Alcohol** step is the most critical; it's the decolorizer.
*   **Bacillus vs. bacillus:** Note that *Bacillus* (capitalized/italicized) is a genus, while "bacillus" (lowercase) refers to the rod shape.
*   **Endospore vs. Reproduction:** Endospores are for **survival**, not for increasing the number of cells (1 cell -> 1 spore -> 1 cell).
