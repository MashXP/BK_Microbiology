# 🦠 Protists

Protists are a diverse group of eukaryotic microorganisms. They are a **polyphyletic** group, meaning they do not share a single common ancestor.

## 🌿 General Characteristics

* **Eukaryotic**: They have a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
* **Unicellular or Multicellular**: Most are unicellular, but some are multicellular (like algae).
* **Nutrition**: Can be **photoautotrophs**, **heterotrophs**, or **mixotrophs** (combining both).
* **Reproduction**: Can reproduce **asexually** or **sexually** (using meiosis and fertilization).
* **Habitat**: Most are aquatic, living in freshwater, marine, or damp environments.

## 🗂️ Modern Classification (Eukaryotic Supergroups)

Protists are now classified into several supergroups based on DNA and morphological similarities, replacing the older "animal-like," "plant-like," and "fungus-like" system.

### 1. Supergroup Excavata
Members are defined by a unique flagellar structure or an "excavated" feeding groove.

* **Diplomonads**:
    * **Example**: *Giardia intestinalis*.
    * **Features**: Have two equal-sized nuclei and reduced mitochondria called **mitosomes** (function anaerobically).
    * **Life Cycle**: Ingestion of dormant **cysts** from contaminated water; they become active **trophozoites** in the intestine.
* **Parabasalids**:
    * **Example**: *Trichomonas vaginalis*.
    * **Features**: Have reduced mitochondria called **hydrogenosomes** (release hydrogen gas). Move using flagella and an **undulating membrane**.
* **Euglenozoans**:
    * **Features**: Distinguished by a **crystalline rod** inside their flagella.
    * **Kinetoplastids**: Example: *Trypanosoma* (causes sleeping sickness). Have a single, large mitochondrion with a **kinetoplast** (a mass of DNA).
    * **Euglenids**: Example: *Euglena*.
        * **Pellicle**: Protein bands beneath the plasma membrane provide strength and flexibility (lacks a cell wall).
        * **Mixotrophic**: A **light detector** and **eyespot (stigma)** allow it to move toward light for photosynthesis.
        * **Contractile vacuole**: Expels excess water.

### 2. Supergroup SAR
A highly diverse group named for its three clades: Stramenopila, Alveolata, and Rhizaria.

* **Stramenopiles**:
    * **Diatoms**: Unicellular algae with a two-part, glass-like wall made of **silica** (a frustule).
    * **Brown Algae**: Multicellular algae (kelp).
        * **Structures**: Have plant-like **blades** (leaves), **stipe** (stem), and **holdfast** (anchor).
        * **Life Cycle**: Exhibit **alternation of generations**, switching between a diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophytes.
    * **Oomycetes (Water Molds)**: Fungus-like protists, but with **cellulose** cell walls. Includes *Phytophthora* (causes potato blight).
* **Alveolates**:
    * **Features**: Have **alveoli** (membrane-enclosed sacs) beneath the plasma membrane.
    * **Dinoflagellates**: Unicellular; two flagella in grooves cause them to **spin**. Blooms can cause toxic "red tides".
    * **Apicomplexans**: Parasites of animals.
        * **Example**: *Plasmodium* (causes malaria).
        * **Features**: Named for their **apical complex**, used to penetrate host cells.
        * **Life Cycle**: Asexual reproduction (merozoites) in human liver and red blood cells; sexual reproduction in *Anopheles* mosquitoes.
    * **Ciliates**:
        * **Example**: *Paramecium*.
        * **Features**: Use **cilia** for movement and feeding. Have a large **macronucleus** (daily functions) and a small **micronucleus** (reproduction).
        * **Reproduction**: Reproduce sexually via **conjugation**, where two cells align and swap haploid micronuclei.
* **Rhizarians**:
    * **Features**: Amoebas with threadlike pseudopodia.
    * **Radiolarians**: Have intricate internal skeletons made of **silica**.
    * **Foraminiferans (Forams)**: Have porous shells, or "tests," hardened with **calcium carbonate**.

### 3. Supergroup Archaeplastida
This supergroup includes red algae, green algae, and land plants.

* **Red Algae (Rhodophyta)**:
    * **Features**: Reddish color from the pigment **phycoerythrin**.
    * **Examples**: *Porphyra* (used to make **nori**) and *Gracilaria* (source of **agarose**).
* **Green Algae (Chlorophyta and Charophytes)**:
    * **Chlorophytes**: A diverse group including unicellular (*Chlamydomonas*), colonial (*Volvox*), and multicellular (*Ulva*) forms.
    * **Charophytes**: The closest living algal relatives of land plants.
        * **Shared Traits with Plants**: 
            1. **Rosette-shaped cellulose synthase complexes**. 
            2. Similar peroxisome enzymes. 
            3. Similar flagellated sperm structure. 
            4. Formation of a **phragmoplast** (microtubules) during cell division.

### 4. Supergroup Unikonta
This supergroup includes protists, fungi, and animals.

* **Amoebozoans**:
    * **Features**: Amoebas with **lobe- or tube-shaped pseudopodia**.
    * **Slime Molds (Mycetozoans)**: "Fungus-animals".
        * **Plasmodial Slime Molds**: The feeding stage is a **plasmodium**—a single, large, multinucleate mass of cytoplasm. It forms sporangia (fruiting bodies) to produce spores.
        * **Cellular Slime Molds**: Example: *Dictyostelium*. Solitary haploid amoebas are the feeding stage. When food is scarce, cells **aggregate** to form a "slug" and a fruiting body. The cells remain as individual cells in the aggregate.
    * **Entamoebas**: Parasitic amoebas, such as *Entamoeba histolytica*.
