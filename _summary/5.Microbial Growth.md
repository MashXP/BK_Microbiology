# 🌱 Microbial Growth

## 📈 The Requirements for Growth

### Physical Requirements

#### 1. Temperature
-   **Psychrophiles**: Cold-loving microbes.
-   **Mesophiles**: Moderate-temperature-loving microbes.
-   **Thermophiles**: Heat-loving microbes.
-   **Psychrotrophs**: Grow between $0^{\circ}C$ and $20-30^{\circ}C$; often cause food spoilage in refrigerators.
-   **Hyperthermophiles**: Extreme heat-loving microbes.

#### 2. pH
-   Most bacteria grow well at a pH between 6.5 and 7.5.
-   Very few bacteria can grow at a pH below 4.
-   Most yeasts and molds grow well at a pH between 5 and 6.
-   Culture media are often supplemented with chemical buffers like peptone, amino acids, or phosphate salts to maintain a stable pH.

#### 3. Osmotic Pressure
-   Bacteria require water for growth.
-   High osmotic pressure (a hypertonic environment) removes water from the cell, causing the cytoplasm to shrink (plasmolysis) and inhibiting growth.
-   **Extreme halophiles** require high salt concentrations for growth.
-   **Facultative halophiles** can tolerate high salt concentrations (up to 2% or even 15%) but do not require them.

### Chemical Requirements

#### 1. Carbon
-   Carbon is the structural backbone of all organic compounds in a cell.
-   Half the dry weight of a typical bacterial cell is carbon.
-   **Chemoheterotrophs** get carbon from organic sources like proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids.
-   **Chemoautotrophs** and **photoautotrophs** get carbon from carbon dioxide (CO₂).

#### 2. Nitrogen, Sulfur, and Phosphorus
-   **Nitrogen**: Needed for synthesizing proteins, DNA, RNA, and ATP.
    -   Sources include protein decomposition, NH₄⁺, NO₃⁻, and atmospheric N₂ (nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria).
    -   **Symbiosis**: Some bacteria (e.g., *Rhizobium*) fix nitrogen in the roots of legumes (like soybeans, peas).
-   **Sulfur**: Needed for synthesizing sulfur-containing amino acids and vitamins like thiamine and biotin.
    -   Sources include SO₄²⁻, H₂S, and sulfur-containing amino acids.
-   **Phosphorus**: Needed for synthesizing nucleic acids, phospholipids, and ATP.
    -   The main source is phosphate ions (PO₄³⁻).

#### 3. Trace Elements
-   These are required in very small amounts and usually function as cofactors for enzymes.
-   Examples include iron (Fe²⁺), copper (Cu²⁺), molybdenum (Mo²⁺), and zinc (Zn²⁺).
-   They are usually present in tap water and other media components.

#### 4. Organic Growth Factors
-   Essential organic compounds that an organism cannot synthesize on its own.
-   Examples include vitamins (which often act as coenzymes), amino acids, purines, and pyrimidines.

#### 5. Photosynthesis Types
-   **Oxygenic**: Uses $H_2O$ to reduce $CO_2$, produces $O_2$ (e.g., Plants, Algae, Cyanobacteria).
-   **Anoxygenic**: Uses Sulfur/$H_2S$ to reduce $CO_2$, does not produce $O_2$ (e.g., Green/Purple Sulfur Bacteria).

#### 6. Oxygen
-   **Obligate Aerobes**: Grow only at the top (high $O_2$). Possess Catalase and SOD to neutralize toxins.
-   **Facultative Anaerobes**: Grow throughout but best at the top. Possess Catalase and SOD.
-   **Obligate Anaerobes**: Grow only at the bottom (no $O_2$). Lack enzymes to neutralize oxygen; killed by $O_2$.
-   **Aerotolerant Anaerobes**: Grow evenly throughout. Possess SOD but lack Catalase.
-   **Microaerophiles**: Grow in the middle (low $O_2$). Produce lethal amounts of toxic oxygen if exposed to atmosphere.
-   **Toxic Forms of Oxygen**:
    -   **Singlet Oxygen (¹O₂)**: A highly reactive, high-energy state of oxygen.
    -   **Superoxide Radicals (O₂⁻)**: Formed during normal respiration. They are toxic and must be neutralized by superoxide dismutase (SOD).
    -   **Detoxification Enzymes**:
        -   **Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)**: Neutralizes superoxide radicals ($O_2^-$).
        -   **Catalase & Peroxidase**: Neutralize hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$) produced by SOD.
            -   **Reaction**: $2H_2O_2 \xrightarrow{Catalase} 2H_2O + O_2$ (bubbles visible).

## 🧪 Culture Media

-   A **culture medium** is a nutrient material prepared for the growth of microorganisms.
-   An **inoculum** is the microbes introduced into a medium to initiate growth.
-   A **culture** is the microbes that grow and multiply in or on the medium.

### Criteria for a Culture Medium:
-   Must contain the right nutrients.
-   Must have sufficient moisture, a proper pH, and a suitable oxygen level.
-   Must be initially sterile.
-   Must be incubated at the proper temperature.

### Types of Media

-   **Agar**: A complex polysaccharide from seaweed used as a solidifying agent. It melts at ~100°C and solidifies at < 40°C.
    -   **Deep agar**: Solid agar in a test tube.
    -   **Slant agar**: Solid agar in a test tube that has been allowed to solidify at an angle.
    -   **Agar plate**: Solid agar in a petri dish.
-   **Chemically Defined Media**: The exact chemical composition is known.
-   **Complex Media**: Made of nutrients from extracts of yeasts, meat, or plants. The exact chemical composition varies.
-   **Reducing Media**: Contain ingredients (like sodium thioglycolate) that chemically combine with and deplete dissolved oxygen. Used for growing anaerobic bacteria.
-   **Selective Media**: Suppress the growth of unwanted bacteria and encourage the growth of desired microbes.
    -   **Selective Example**: Bismuth Sulfite Agar (isolates *Salmonella Typhi*).
-   **Differential Media**: Make it easier to distinguish colonies of a desired organism from others on the same plate.
    -   **Differential Example**: Blood Agar (identifies *Streptococcus pyogenes* via hemolysis).
-   **Enrichment Media**: A liquid medium that provides nutrients and conditions to favor the growth of a particular microbe that may be present in small numbers.

### Anaerobic Methods
-   **Anaerobic Jar/Chamber**: Uses chemicals (like a gas pack) to remove $O_2$ and generate $CO_2$ and $H_2$. Palladium catalysts turn remaining $O_2$ into water.
-   **Candle Jar**: Creates high $CO_2$ environment (Capnophiles).

## 🔬 Obtaining Pure Cultures

-   A **colony** is a visible mass of microbial cells that theoretically arises from a single spore or vegetative cell.
-   A **pure culture** contains only one species or strain.
-   The **streak plate method** is the most common method used to isolate pure cultures. It involves spreading a small amount of inoculum over the surface of an agar plate in a way that individual cells are separated from each other.
