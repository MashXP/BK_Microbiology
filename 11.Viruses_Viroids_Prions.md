# 🦠 Viruses, Viroids, and Prions

This chapter explores acellular infectious agents: viruses, viroids, and prions.

## 🔬 Viruses

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning they can only replicate inside a living host cell. A **virion** is a complete, infectious viral particle.

### Viral Structure

-   **Nucleic Acid**: The genetic material of a virus can be:
    -   DNA or RNA
    -   Single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds)
    -   Linear or circular
-   **Capsid**: A protein coat that encloses and protects the nucleic acid. It is composed of protein subunits called **capsomeres**. The arrangement of capsomeres gives the capsid its shape:
    -   **Helical**: Capsomeres are arranged in a hollow, cylindrical helix (e.g., Ebola virus, Tobacco mosaic virus).
    -   **Polyhedral (Icosahedral)**: A many-sided, roughly spherical shape (e.g., Adenovirus, Poliovirus).
    -   **Complex**: Have a complicated structure, often with multiple parts (e.g., Bacteriophages with a head, sheath, and tail fibers).
-   **Envelope**: A lipid, protein, and carbohydrate covering around the capsid, found in some viruses. It is often derived from the host cell's membrane (e.g., Influenzavirus, Herpesvirus).
-   **Spikes**: Carbohydrate-protein complexes that may project from the surface of the envelope and are used for attachment to host cells.

### Viral Taxonomy & Classification

-   **Order** names end in `-ales`.
-   **Family** names end in `-viridae` (e.g., *Herpesviridae*).
-   **Genus** names end in `-virus` (e.g., *Varicellovirus*).
-   A **viral species** is a group of viruses sharing the same genetic information and ecological niche (host range).
-   **Example: *Herpesviridae* Family**
    -   **HHV-1 & HHV-2** (*Simplexvirus*): Cause cold sores.
    -   **HHV-3** (*Varicellovirus*): Causes chickenpox.
    -   **HHV-4** (*Lymphocryptovirus*): Causes infectious mononucleosis.
    -   **HHV-5** (*Cytomegalovirus*): Causes CMV inclusion disease.
    -   **HHV-8** (*Rhadinovirus*): Causes Kaposi's sarcoma.
-   **Baltimore Classification**: A system that classifies viruses into seven groups based on their type of genome and its replication strategy.
    -   **Group I**: dsDNA viruses
    -   **Group II**: ssDNA viruses
    -   **Group III**: dsRNA viruses
    -   **Group IV**: (+)ssRNA viruses (can act directly as mRNA)
    -   **Group V**: (-)ssRNA viruses (must be transcribed to (+)RNA)
    -   **Group VI**: ssRNA-RT viruses (Retroviruses, e.g., HIV)
    -   **Group VII**: dsDNA-RT viruses

### Viral Multiplication

Viruses use the host cell's machinery (ribosomes, enzymes, ATP) to replicate.

#### Multiplication of Animal Viruses
1.  **Attachment**: The virus attaches to specific receptors on the host cell surface, often using spikes.
2.  **Entry**: The virus enters the cell.
    -   **Receptor-mediated endocytosis**: The host cell's membrane folds inward, engulfing the virion.
    -   **Fusion**: The viral envelope fuses directly with the host cell's plasma membrane, releasing the capsid into the cytoplasm (e.g., Herpesvirus, HIV).
3.  **Uncoating**: The viral nucleic acid is released from the capsid by viral or host enzymes.
4.  **Biosynthesis**: The viral nucleic acid is replicated, and viral proteins are synthesized.
    -   **DNA viruses** (e.g., Papovavirus) generally replicate their DNA in the host's **nucleus**, using host polymerases.
    -   **RNA viruses** (e.g., Picornavirus) generally replicate their RNA in the host's **cytoplasm**, using their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
    -   **Retroviruses** (e.g., HIV) use **reverse transcriptase** to make a DNA copy of their RNA genome, which then integrates into the host's chromosome as a **provirus**.
5.  **Maturation**: New viral particles are assembled.
6.  **Release**: The new virions are released.
    -   **Budding**: Enveloped viruses are released as they "bud" off from the host cell membrane, acquiring their envelope in the process.
    -   **Lysis**: Non-enveloped viruses are often released by causing the host cell to rupture and die.

#### Multiplication of Bacteriophages
Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. They can undergo two types of replication cycles:

1.  **The Lytic Cycle**: The phage replicates and causes the host cell to lyse (burst), releasing new phages. This is characteristic of **virulent phages** (e.g., T-even phage).
    -   **Attachment**: Phage attaches to the host cell wall using its tail fibers.
    -   **Penetration**: Phage injects its DNA into the host cell using its tail sheath.
    -   **Biosynthesis**: Phage DNA directs the synthesis of viral components.
    -   **Maturation**: Viral components are assembled into new phages.
    -   **Release**: The host cell lyses (due to phage-produced lysozyme) and releases the new phages.
2.  **The Lysogenic Cycle**: The phage DNA integrates into the host cell's chromosome, becoming a **prophage**. The host cell can survive and reproduce normally, replicating the prophage along with its own DNA. This is characteristic of **temperate phages** (e.g., phage lambda).
    -   An event like UV radiation can trigger the prophage to excise from the host chromosome and enter the lytic cycle.

## 🌱 Viroids and Virusoids

-   **Viroids**: Short pieces of naked, circular, single-stranded RNA (300-400 nucleotides long) with no protein coat.
    -   The RNA molecule has a folded, three-dimensional structure that protects it from cellular enzymes.
    -   They are replicated by the host cell's **RNA polymerase**.
    -   The viroid RNA itself can function as a **ribozyme** (an enzyme made of RNA).
    -   They cause several plant diseases, such as **potato spindle tuber disease** (*Pospiviroid*) and **coconut cadang-cadang** (*Cocadviroid*).
    -   They are classified into families like *Pospiviroidae* and *Avsunviroidae*.
-   **Virusoids**: Viroid-like particles that are enclosed in a protein coat from another "helper" virus. They can only cause disease when the cell is also infected by the helper virus.

## 🧠 Prions

-   **Pr**oteinaceous **I**nfectious **On**ly particles.
-   They are infectious proteins that cause several fatal neurodegenerative diseases, known as **transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs)**.
    -   Examples: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (in humans), mad cow disease (in cattle), and scrapie (in sheep).
-   **Mechanism**:
    1.  A normal, cellular prion protein (**PrPC**) is on the cell surface.
    2.  An abnormal, misfolded scrapie protein (**PrPSc**) is acquired (e.g., by ingestion) or produced by a mutation.
    3.  The abnormal **PrPSc** contacts a normal **PrPC** and converts it into the abnormal **PrPSc** form.
    4.  This starts a chain reaction, where newly converted **PrPSc** proteins convert more **PrPC** proteins.
    5.  The abnormal **PrPSc** proteins are taken into the cell, where they accumulate in endosomes and lysosomes.
    6.  This accumulation of **PrPSc** forms plaques in the brain, causing brain cell death and the characteristic "spongy" (spongiform) appearance of the brain tissue.
-   Prions are extremely resistant to heat, radiation, and proteases.
